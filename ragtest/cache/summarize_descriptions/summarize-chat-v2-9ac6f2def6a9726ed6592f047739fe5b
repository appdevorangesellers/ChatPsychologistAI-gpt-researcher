{"result": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that arises from experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It affects individuals of all ages, but is particularly prevalent among children, adolescents, and youths, including those involved in the juvenile justice system. PTSD is characterized by a range of symptoms, including severe anxiety, flashbacks, nightmares, and other distressing reactions. \n\nThe condition often requires careful diagnosis and intervention, especially in younger populations, as it can overlap with other disorders, such as conduct disorder. PTSD is frequently discussed in forensic contexts, highlighting its relevance in legal and justice-related settings. Specific diagnostic criteria for PTSD are outlined in the DSM-5, which provides a framework for understanding and identifying the disorder. Overall, PTSD is a significant mental health concern that necessitates attention and appropriate treatment to support affected individuals.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
