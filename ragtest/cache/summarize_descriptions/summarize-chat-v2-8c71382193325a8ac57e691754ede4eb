{"result": "Cognitive Developmental Delay refers to a condition characterized by a significant lag in a child's cognitive functioning and development compared to their peers. This delay manifests as the child not reaching expected cognitive milestones at the appropriate times. It is often associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, and can also be linked to other mental disorders. The condition highlights a slower than typical development of cognitive skills in children, indicating a need for early intervention and support to help them achieve their developmental potential.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
