{"result": "Criminal responsibility is a legal concept that addresses the accountability of individuals for their actions, particularly in the context of criminal behavior. It is often evaluated in cases involving minors, where the question arises as to whether they can be held responsible for their actions. Additionally, criminal responsibility is also assessed in relation to individuals with mental health issues, determining if their mental state at the time of the crime affects their accountability.
