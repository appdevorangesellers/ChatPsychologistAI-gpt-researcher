{"result": "Aggressive youths are children and adolescents, often minors, who exhibit high levels of aggression characterized by violent or hostile behavior. This aggression is frequently linked to underlying mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or conduct disorder. These individuals often require mental health interventions due to the severity of their behaviors, which can lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system and conflicts with the law or other individuals. The aggressive behaviors displayed by these youths may stem from trauma exposure and are indicative of deeper psychological challenges that necessitate professional support and intervention.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
