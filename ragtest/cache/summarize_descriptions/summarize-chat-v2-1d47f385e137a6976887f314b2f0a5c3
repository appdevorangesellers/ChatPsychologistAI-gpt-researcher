{"result": "Asperger's Disorder is a condition on the autism spectrum that primarily affects social interaction and communication. It is characterized by significant difficulties in these areas, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Notably, individuals with Asperger's Disorder do not typically experience intellectual impairment. \n\nHistorically, Asperger's Disorder was classified as a distinct diagnosis in the DSM-IV; however, it has since been subsumed under the broader category of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the DSM-5. This change has raised concerns regarding stigma and access to services for those previously diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder. The reclassification reflects a shift in understanding the spectrum of autism, emphasizing the need for a more inclusive approach to diagnosis and support.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
