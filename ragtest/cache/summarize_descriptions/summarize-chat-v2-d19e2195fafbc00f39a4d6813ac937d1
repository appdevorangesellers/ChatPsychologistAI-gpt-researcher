{"result": "False confessions refer to admissions of guilt made by individuals who are actually innocent of the crimes they are accused of committing. These confessions are particularly prevalent among juveniles, especially those with conduct disorders, as their immaturity and limited understanding of the legal process can make them more susceptible to coercive interrogation techniques and psychological pressure. The phenomenon highlights the vulnerabilities of young individuals in the justice system, where the combination of their developmental stage and the high-stress environment of interrogations can lead to false admissions of guilt.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
