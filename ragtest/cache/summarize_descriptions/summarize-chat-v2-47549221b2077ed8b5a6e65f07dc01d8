This disorder is characterized by frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol, which can significantly impact the individual's daily functioning and social interactions. DMDD is particularly concerning as it may predispose affected youths to develop unipolar depressive disorders and anxiety disorders later in life.
