{"result": "Youths with treatable mental disorders represent a significant population that requires attention, particularly in juvenile settings. Many of these youths experience mental health issues that can be effectively addressed, yet often go overlooked. For instance, those with conduct disorder may also have additional treatable mental disorders, which can adversely affect their rehabilitation and legal outcomes. Early identification and intervention are crucial for these youths, as appropriate interventions can lead to improved mental health and better legal outcomes.
