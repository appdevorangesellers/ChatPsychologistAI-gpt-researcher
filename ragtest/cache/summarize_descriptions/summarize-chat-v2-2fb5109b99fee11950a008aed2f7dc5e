{"result": "Intellectual Disability is a condition that is assessed and diagnosed through various criteria, one of the most critical being Adaptive Functioning. Adaptive Functioning evaluates an individual's ability to manage daily tasks and living skills, making it a key component in the diagnostic process. It plays a vital role in understanding how well an individual can navigate everyday life, which is essential for determining the presence and severity of intellectual disability. The assessment of Adaptive Functioning is therefore integral to the overall evaluation and diagnosis of intellectual disability, as it provides insight into the individual's practical capabilities in managing daily life.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
