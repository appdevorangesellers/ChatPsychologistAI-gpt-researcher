{"result": "Rosa's Law significantly influenced the DSM-5 by prompting a change in the terminology used for intellectual disabilities. Specifically, the law led to the replacement of the term \"mental retardation\" with \"intellectual disability\" throughout the DSM-5. This change reflects a broader movement towards more respectful and accurate language regarding individuals with intellectual disabilities. The DSM-5 incorporates these changes, demonstrating the impact of Rosa's Law on the language and classification of intellectual disabilities within the field of mental health.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
