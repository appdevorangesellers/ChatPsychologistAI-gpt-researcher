{"result": "Forensic psychiatry is a specialized field that frequently relies on the classifications and diagnostic criteria established in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) for evaluating and diagnosing mental health conditions in legal contexts. The DSM-5 serves as a critical tool for forensic psychiatrists, providing them with the necessary criteria to assess individuals involved in legal cases where mental health issues are pertinent. This reliance on the DSM-5 ensures that forensic evaluations are grounded in standardized diagnostic frameworks, facilitating a more accurate understanding of the mental health status of individuals within the legal system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
