{"result": "M. J. Meaney is a prominent researcher and author recognized for her extensive studies on maternal care and its profound effects on stress reactivity and gene expression across generations. Her work has been published in reputable journals, including the Annual Review of Neuroscience. Meaney's research delves into how maternal care influences stress reactivity and regulation, highlighting the intergenerational impacts of these factors. Through her investigations, she has contributed significantly to the understanding of the biological and psychological mechanisms underlying maternal care and its long-term effects on offspring.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
