This demographic is often affected by higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related behaviors, which contribute to their overrepresentation in the system. The unique challenges faced by Latino youths, including trauma and mental health issues, highlight the need for targeted mental health interventions to address these systemic problems.
