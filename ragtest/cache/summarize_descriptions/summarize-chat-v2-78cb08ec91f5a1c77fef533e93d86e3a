{"result": "Bipolar Disorder and Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder are both mood disorders that primarily affect children and adolescents. There is a notable relationship between the two conditions, as children diagnosed with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder are more likely to develop Bipolar Disorder later in life. However, the two disorders differ in terms of symptom duration and presentation.
