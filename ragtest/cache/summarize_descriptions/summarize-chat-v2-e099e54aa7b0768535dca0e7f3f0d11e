{"result": "Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) is a mental health condition that occurs in children who have experienced severe neglect or abuse, leading to significant difficulties in forming healthy emotional attachments with caregivers. This disorder is characterized by a child's inability to establish secure and trusting relationships, often as a result of disruptions in their early relationships or caregiving environments. Reactive Attachment Disorder is classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which provides criteria for diagnosis.
