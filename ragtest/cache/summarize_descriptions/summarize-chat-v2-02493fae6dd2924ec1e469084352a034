{"result": "Litigation refers to the process of taking legal action to resolve disputes, which can encompass a variety of legal matters, including those related to specific learning disorders and the need for accommodations in educational and workplace settings. It often arises when individuals with Specific Learning Disorder or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) seek supportive services or reasonable accommodations that may be denied based on criteria outlined in the DSM-5. Disputes may occur over the necessity of these supportive services or accommodations, leading to legal proceedings aimed at addressing issues such as educational services, discrimination, and the validity of contracts related to mental health diagnoses. Overall, litigation serves as a means for individuals with specific learning disorders or intellectual disabilities to advocate for their rights and access to necessary support in various contexts, including education and employment.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
