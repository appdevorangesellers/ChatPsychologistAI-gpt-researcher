{"result": "Developmental milestones refer to the key skills and behaviors that children typically achieve as they grow, including physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development. However, the presence of mental disorders in children and adolescents can significantly disrupt these milestones. Mental disorders can interfere with a child's ability to reach these developmental milestones, impacting their overall growth and development. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the relationship between developmental milestones and mental disorders, as the latter can hinder a child's progress in achieving essential developmental goals.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
