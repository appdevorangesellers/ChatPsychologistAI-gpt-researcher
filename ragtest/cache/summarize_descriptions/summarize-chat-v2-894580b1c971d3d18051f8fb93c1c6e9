{"result": "Rosa's Law is a significant legislative measure that officially changed the terminology from \"mental retardation\" to \"intellectual disability\" in U.S. federal law. This change reflects a broader societal shift in understanding cognitive impairments and aligns legal language with contemporary perspectives on the condition. The law has had a profound impact on legal and medical documentation, influencing how intellectual disability is perceived, diagnosed, and treated. By adopting this new terminology, Rosa's Law not only modernizes the language used in legal definitions but also signifies a shift in societal attitudes towards individuals with intellectual disabilities. The enactment of Rosa's Law has contributed to a more respectful and accurate understanding of cognitive impairments, as evidenced by its influence on the language used in the DSM-5. Overall, Rosa's Law represents a crucial step in promoting a more inclusive and informed approach to intellectual disability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
