{"result": "Atypical antipsychotics are a class of medications commonly prescribed for various psychiatric conditions, including mood disorders and psychotic disorders. They are often utilized in the treatment of children diagnosed with bipolar disorder and related mood disorders, such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. While these medications can be effective in managing symptoms, their use in children may be reduced when appropriate treatments for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are implemented. Atypical antipsychotics are known to have significant side effects, which necessitates careful consideration when prescribing them, particularly for younger patients.
