This legislative act reflects a significant shift in societal understanding and terminology regarding intellectual disabilities, aiming to reduce stigma and promote more respectful language. By changing the terminology used in federal health, education, and labor policy, Rosa's Law seeks to foster a better understanding of cognitive impairments and to influence terminology in clinical practice, including its impact on the DSM-5.
