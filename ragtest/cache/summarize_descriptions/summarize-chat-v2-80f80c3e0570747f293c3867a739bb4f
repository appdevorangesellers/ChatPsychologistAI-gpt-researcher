{"result": "The DSM-5 and ICD-10 are both authoritative sources that provide diagnostic criteria for intellectual disabilities. They have aligned their terminology and coding systems to facilitate consistency in mental health diagnoses. The DSM-5 has made changes to its diagnostic criteria that correspond with the updates in the ICD-10, ensuring that the diagnostic codes in ICD-10 reflect these changes. This alignment not only aids in the transition between the two systems but also ensures that both documents reflect the most current understanding and terminology related to intellectual disabilities. Overall, the DSM-5 and ICD-10 work in tandem to provide a coherent framework for diagnosing intellectual disabilities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
