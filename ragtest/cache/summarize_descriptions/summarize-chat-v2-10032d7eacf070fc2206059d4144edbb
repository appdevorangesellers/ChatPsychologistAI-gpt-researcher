{"result": "Intellectual disability and mental retardation refer to the same condition, but the terminology has evolved significantly over time. The term \"mental retardation\" is now considered outdated and has been replaced by \"intellectual disability\" in both legal and clinical contexts. This change reflects a broader effort to reduce stigma associated with the condition. Modern diagnostic criteria, including those outlined in the DSM-5, no longer use the term mental retardation, emphasizing the shift towards the more appropriate and sensitive term, intellectual disability.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
