{"result": "Conduct Disorder is a mental health condition diagnosed primarily in children and adolescents, characterized by a persistent pattern of behavior that violates societal norms and the rights of others. This disorder often manifests through disruptive and violent behaviors, which can lead to significant difficulties in social, academic, and legal settings. It is frequently observed in youths who are involved in the juvenile justice system, and it may result in serious legal issues.\n\nThe diagnosis of Conduct Disorder is included in the DSM-5, where it is recognized as a more severe behavioral disorder. The behaviors associated with Conduct Disorder can include aggression, deceitfulness, destruction of property, and serious violations of rules. This condition not only affects the individual but can also have broader implications, potentially leading to more serious mental health issues in adulthood if left unaddressed.\n\nOverall, Conduct Disorder represents a significant challenge for affected youths, often requiring intervention to help manage the behaviors and mitigate the associated risks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
