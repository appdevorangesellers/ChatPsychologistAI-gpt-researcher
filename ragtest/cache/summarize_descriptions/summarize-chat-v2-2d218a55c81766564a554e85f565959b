{"result": "Native American youths are a demographic group consisting of children and adolescents from indigenous tribes in the United States. This group is characterized by higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which have been observed even after accounting for various demographic factors and exposure to trauma. The prevalence of PTSD among Native American youths is significant, and they often face unique challenges that may contribute to their mental health issues.\n\nAdditionally, Native American youths are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, indicating a potential intersection between their mental health struggles and involvement with legal authorities. The experiences of trauma and the resulting mental health challenges necessitate culturally sensitive approaches in diagnosis and intervention for this population. Overall, Native American youths represent a vulnerable group that requires attention and support to address their mental health needs and the systemic issues they face.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
