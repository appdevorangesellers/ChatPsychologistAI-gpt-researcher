Although some changes are welcome and needed, others have been controversial. In this article, I examine the diagnostic changes along with some of the associated controversies and resolutions. The implications for the practice of child forensic psychiatry, including problems that may be encountered by forensic psychiatrists who evaluate adults with childhood-onset mental disorders, are examined. The pitfalls associated with improper use of The Manual by legal professionals are also reviewed.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 represents the culmination of a multinational interdisciplinary effort to incorporate a body of empirical studies into a resource for classifying mental illness (Ref. 1, p.7). The DSM-5 Child and Adolescent Disorders Work Group was cognizant of the controversy surrounding their recommendation to reclassify several DSM-IV2 disorders, including some that affect children and adolescents. The contents of DSM-5, at times, reflect their responsiveness to those concerns.3In this article, I examine changes in DSM-5 regarding disorders that have their onset primarily in childhood and adolescence and I focus on disorders that are more likely to be encountered by child forensic psychiatrists in the course of practice. The discussion may also be of interest to forensic mental health professionals who work with adults who have childhood-onset mental disorders.The implications of a mental disorder in a child or adolescent are substantial. The disorder may interfere with normal development and the youth's efforts to relate to family and peers and to reach normal developmental milestones, such as becoming independent, caring for himself, interacting with peers, and obtaining an education. Therefore, identifying and addressing psychiatric disorders in children is imperative.Although the end of childhood has been legislatively defined for educational, legal, and other purposes, there is no evidence-based endpoint for the neurodevelopmental period. For this reason, DSM-5 contains no references to the age at which the neurodevelopmental period ends and adulthood begins. Yet, the point at which individuals are reasonably expected to transition from childhood to adulthood is the crux of many of the controversies involving psychiatric disorders, including those affecting children and adolescents. Many youths encounter challenges and setbacks as they navigate the social and educational systems on their way to independence. This can be a normal part of the developmental process and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health, including the classification of diseases and health problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>American Psychiatric Publishing is a publisher of books and journals related to psychiatry, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>EVENT<|>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is a manual used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders, reflecting changes and controversies in the classification of these disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>EVENT<|>Child forensic psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry that focuses on the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with mental disorders, particularly in legal contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S.K. v.
