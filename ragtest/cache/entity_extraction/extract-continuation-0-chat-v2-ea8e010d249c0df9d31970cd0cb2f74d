Although Brave Heart (2003) emphasizes psychological distress as a common historical trauma response, as noted previously, other scholars have identified a range of negative health outcomes in response to historical trauma. For example, authors working with diverse populations throughout the world link historical traumas to such contemporary sequelae as predisposition to PTSD (Karenian et al., 2011; Kellermann, 2001b); symptoms of anxiety and depression, with a preponderance of shame and fear (Carolina Lopez, 2011; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Whitbeck et al., 2009); and disruptions to family and parent-child relationships (Bar-On et al., 1998; Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011). Similarly, numerous authors use historical trauma as an explanatory framework for understanding a wide-range of health disparities with psychological, social, and biological mechanisms (Crawford, 2013; Daley, 2006; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Sotero, 2006; Walters et al., 2011). Despite this range of potential health impacts, Gone (2013) emphasizes that the development of the notion of historical trauma originates out of the psychological literature, and therefore most discussions of historical trauma preference negative behavioral health impacts. Further, as summarized earlier, health impacts may exemplify wound and survival, trauma and resilience (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008).Illustrations of the Model Narratives of loss and resilience Historical trauma narratives do not always offer a clear path to either wounding or resilience, but instead may indicate both of these responses simultaneously. For example, among many indigenous groups around the world, the history of being colonized forms a common narrative that includes being displaced from traditional land and resources, physically and culturally slaughtered, and portrayed by the dominant culture as uncivilized and less evolved (Duran, 2006). This narrative presents a history of trauma, including disease, warfare, colonization, cultural genocide, and poverty, yet it is also a story of ongoing resistance (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011)—it is a history of devastation and survival. Native American reservations in the U.S. and the coerced resettlement of Inuit into government towns in Canada serve as powerful examples of how historical trauma narratives can simultaneously manifest a sense of loss and resilience. This history carries a legacy of imprisonment—with reservations and government settlements serving as ongoing symbols of confinement and loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Conversely, these communities are also sites of resilience, where indigenous peoples maintain traditional family structures and provide rich enculturation (Walters, Simoni, & Evans-Campbell, 2002). Thus, reservations and government settlements serve a dual function—as reminders of loss as well as places that sustain cultural identity and continuity. A similar narrative of loss and resilience is found in Abramowitz’s (2005) description of how the public narratives of communities in the Guinean Languette after attacks on their villages resulted in varying post-traumatic symptoms. Those villages that created narratives of group trauma that stressed community persistence and the survival of cultural systems had lower rates of post-traumatic symptoms; in contrast, villages with public narratives that emphasized the destruction of the community’s local moral world exhibited higher post-conflict symptoms (Abramowitz, 2005). This example also illustrates two related observations about narratives of loss and resilience: 1) how the wide variation in public narratives about trauma may result in markedly varying health impacts, and 2) how varying health impacts may be observed despite common traumatic experiences. Examples of public narratives emblematic of loss and resilience are also evident in the experiences of other historically oppressed cultural groups, including descendants of the Armenian genocide during the Ottoman Empire, descendants of Stalinist persecution in Russian, African American, and aboriginal or indigenous peoples across the world. It is not uncommon for these narratives to include experiences of genocide, forced relocation, enslavement, and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; often alongside narratives of resistance, survival, hope, and resilience (Baker & Gippenreiter, 1998; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Fullilove, 2005; Karenian et al., 2011; Kienzler, 2008; Pollack, 2003; Wexler et al., 2009).Historical trauma narratives response to disaster Although historical trauma has mostly been developed to explain the experiences of historically marginalized ethnic groups, the construct is also relevant to understanding individual and community health for groups who have experienced a natural disaster. As Cox and Perry (2011) note in describing how a large wildfire in British Columbia fundamentally altered the community psyche of the two towns most damaged by the fire, place-based traumas also engender public narratives that can impact health. Cox and Perry (2011) show how narratives portraying positive outcomes, such as strengthened sense of community, as well as negative ones, such as feelings of anxiety towards the stability and safety of place, were evident following this disaster. They also show how each of these narratives were related to people’s sense of place. In another example, Long and Wong (2012) describe how the tension between national and local sense of recovery time following the Wenchuan earthquake in China exacerbated a sense of communal trauma. Instead of allowing community members to recover from this disaster at a pace that accommodated their personal and public narratives, members were deluged with national support and public expectations for a speedy recovery that conflicted with these narratives\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological wounds experienced by a group due to historical events such as colonization, genocide, and forced relocation, impacting their health and well-being across generations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS<|>GEO<|>Native American reservations in the U.S. are areas of land managed by Native American tribes, serving as both symbols of confinement and sites of cultural resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INUIT GOVERNMENT TOWNS<|>GEO<|>Government towns in Canada where Inuit peoples were coerced to resettle, representing a history of trauma and loss but also cultural continuity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>GEO<|>A region in Guinea that experienced attacks on villages, leading to varying post-traumatic symptoms based on community narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>EVENT<|>The Armenian genocide was the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, leading to historical trauma for descendants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>EVENT<|>Stalinist persecution refers to the political repression and mass killings of various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, contributing to historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>African Americans are descendants of enslaved Africans in the United States, who have experienced historical trauma through slavery, segregation, and ongoing discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABORIGINAL PEOPLES<|>PERSON<|>Aboriginal peoples are the indigenous peoples of Australia, who have faced colonization, cultural genocide, and ongoing marginalization, leading to historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILDFIRE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA<|>EVENT<|>A large wildfire that significantly impacted the community psyche of two towns in British Columbia, altering public narratives and health outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE<|>EVENT<|>The Wenchuan earthquake was a devastating earthquake in China in 2008 that caused significant loss of life and property, leading to communal trauma and recovery challenges.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Native American reservations are a direct result of historical trauma, representing both loss and resilience for indigenous peoples<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INUIT GOVERNMENT TOWNS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Inuit government towns symbolize the historical trauma experienced by Inuit peoples due to forced resettlement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Guinean Languette's experiences of violence and trauma contribute to the broader understanding of historical trauma narratives<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Armenian genocide is a historical event that has led to ongoing trauma for descendants, shaping their cultural narratives<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Stalinist persecution has resulted in historical trauma for various ethnic groups, affecting their collective memory and health<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICANS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>African Americans experience historical trauma due to the legacy of slavery and systemic racism, impacting their health and well-being<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABORIGINAL PEOPLES<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Aboriginal peoples face historical trauma from colonization and cultural genocide, influencing their narratives of resilience<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILDFIRE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The wildfire's impact on community psyche illustrates how place-based traumas can lead to historical trauma narratives<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Wenchuan earthquake exemplifies how natural disasters can create historical trauma narratives within affected communities<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
