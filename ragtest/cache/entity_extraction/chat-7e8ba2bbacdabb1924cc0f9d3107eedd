The DTD diagnosis offers an all-encompassing conceptualization, within a single diagnostic, developmental syndrome, of the many different symptoms that may be experienced as a result of early trauma. The diagnosis may help limit the over-pathologizing of these individuals (i.e., they would receive a single diagnosis to capture their broad array of symptoms as opposed to three or more disparate diagnoses). More importantly, utilization of the DTD framework may increase the likelihood of more accurate assessment; appropriate symptom management; well-aligned, effective treatments; and better short- and long-term outcomes. Recognition of complex trauma may provide insights that could enhance the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis for these individuals and, at the same time, build or enhance their strengths (which are likely to be undermined if a positive psychology framework does not balance a traditional, deficit-driven approach). Application of the DTD diagnosis may help decrease inappropriate and inadequate treatment approaches by using multi-system and multidisciplinary approaches when working with individuals who have suffered repeated and severe early abuse. Consistent with Bronfenbrenner's theoretical model, an appreciation of the pervasiveness and range of opportunities to reverse the adverse effects of DTD would allow for additional, coordinated efforts among educational, legal, medical, and political leaders and stakeholders. This type of understanding will be required for substantive change to occur for individuals diagnosed with this disorder. At the organizational level, systems must promote formal policies that acknowledge, respect, and de-stigmatize DTD. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Trauma-Informed Approach, this can be accomplished by engendering principles of neurodiversity, implementing social justice frameworks, and acknowledging the multiplicity of trauma associated with various minority statuses (209). Recommended system-wide policies and procedures include enhanced and coordinated evaluation protocols, formal response training, long-term care initiatives, and community engagement aimed at recognizing, supporting, and treating those with DTD (210–212). In sum, research studies have established that developmental trauma confers significant risks to the health and wellbeing of those who have experienced early, repeated interpersonal traumas. Disturbances in attachment, emotion regulation, self-perception, and worldview assumptions are precipitated by trauma and cause a broad range of correlated psychological and medical disorders. Future studies are needed to reconcile several outstanding questions related to ACEs. For example, psychometric investigations of individuals who have experienced ACEs raise the possibility that additional typologies may be present [e.g., borderline personality and resilient subgroupings; (66, 213)]. Another avenue for research concerns the possibility that complex trauma is correlated with multiple sensitive periods, particularly for individuals who have been subjected to prolonged violence exposure. Lastly, although ACEs have been widely studied and consistently predict traumatic responses in adults, the construct encompasses a broad range of adversities, such as parent divorce, sexual assault, and neglect, which may confer different traumatic adaptations.Author contributions DC was responsible for the conceptualization, organization, and final draft of the manuscript.
