PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC9352895 PMID: 35935425 Abstract Children exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and pervasive interpersonal traumas may go on to develop PTSD and, in most cases, will further undergo a significant shift in their developmental trajectory. This paper examines contemporary research on Developmental Trauma (DT), which is inextricably linked to disruptions in social cognition, physiological and behavioral regulation, and parent-child attachments. Developmental trauma associated with early experiences of abuse or neglect leads to multi-faceted and longstanding consequences and underscores critical periods of development, complex stress-mediated adaptations, and multilevel, trans-theoretical influences in the diagnostic formulation and treatment of traumatized children, adolescents, and adults. Psychological and medical correlates of Developmental Trauma Disorder are considered, and directions for future research are discussed. Keywords: developmental trauma disorder, complex trauma, adverse childhood experiences, PTSD, Bronfenbrenner's There has been much interest in understanding the prevalence and impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which refer to potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood and adolescence (e.g., abuse, rejection, and abandonment by caregivers; loss of a caregiver; interpersonal violence exposure). Recent developments suggest that multiple, repeated experiences of ACEs and interpersonal traumas have broad, cumulative, and lasting effects [e.g., (1, 2)]. Children are more likely than adults to lack the cognitive and behavioral capacities to understand and respond to traumatic circumstances effectively. Children affected by interpersonal trauma often experience more global and profound changes than adults who conceivably have more developed adaptations to stress and more cognitive resources to mitigate risks and promote resiliency. The current article provides discussion of how early, repeated interpersonal traumas can interrupt the development of secure attachment and precipitate the emergence of chronic and severe traumatic adaptations, followed by an analysis of contemporary research, conceptual and diagnostic issues, and assessment and treatment. The paper concludes with a discussion about future directions for research and practice. Trauma and PTSD Children and adults who have experienced trauma and developed measurable mental health symptoms associated with the trauma may present with indications of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that warrant careful diagnostic evaluation. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder brought on by exposure to a highly stressful and potentially life-threatening event such as a natural disaster, motor vehicle accident, witnessing family or community violence, experiencing abuse and neglect, or losing a loved one. The symptoms of PTSD, as defined by the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, are characterized by persistent and intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal (i.e., heightened startle in response to unexpected sounds or movements), deliberate avoidance of trauma reminders, and alterations to conscious awareness (i.e., dissociation, derealization, and depersonalization). Persistent trauma symptoms (i.e., that last longer than a month after the traumatic event(s) and are accompanied by social, behavioral, and academic impairments) indicate the presence of PTSD and differentiate it from other psychiatric disturbances [e.g., (3)]. Healthcare providers widely use the DSM-5 to determine whether a person's symptoms are severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD. However, individuals exposed to ACEs, pervasive interpersonal traumas, and polyvictimization [multiple, repeated ACEs; (4–8)] may not only go on to develop PTSD, but may also undergo significant shifts in their developmental trajectories. The changes are often widespread, adversely affecting their biological, social, cognitive, emotional, and spiritual/existential development (1, 9–11). Moreover, these experiences tend to threaten core beliefs and assumptions, including their self-esteem as well as their sense of lovability, vulnerability, and faith in family, friendships, and a higher power. Trauma survivors often face lifelong challenges in developing and maintaining trusting relationships; building and utilizing healthy coping strategies; and adjusting to school and, eventually, the workplace (12–14). For example, ACEs positively predict PTSD, recurrent depression, and repeated suicide attempts (15–17), and findings from several meta-analyses consistently link ACEs to enduring and debilitating psychiatric\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
