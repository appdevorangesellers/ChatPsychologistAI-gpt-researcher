Researchers have described several adverse physiological alterations underlying cognitive disturbances in children who have experienced early traumas (13, 117–124). These include, for example, stress-mediated changes to the organization and functioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, which exert influence over fear processing, including automatic (impulsive) behavioral responses to perceived threats (125–130), learning and memory [fear memories override attention, concentration, and, in turn, inhibit learning of new information; (72, 131, 132)], and higher-order (complex) cognitive operations [e.g., problem-solving and learning from experience, stress appraisal and reappraisal, perceived controllability; (133–135)]. As an illustration of this, reinforcement and contingency learning studies indicate that children who had experienced severe adversity or developmental trauma are not able to adjust their behavior effectively to shifting environments or demands, regardless of threatening and non-threatening circumstances (136, 137). These findings suggest that individuals who have endured significant stress in their lives, especially during early childhood or adolescence, are at increased risk of experiencing avoidance, anger, frustration, and anxiety as primary ways of being in the world, regardless of their circumstances (138–140). These types of responses can be damaging to an individual's development and ability to function, particularly if their safety needs are undermined. Repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents become habituated to evaluating their surroundings for indications of threat that might render them vulnerable to additional traumas, given that they had limited opportunities to recover from the early and repeated abuse and neglect. Researchers speculate that the mechanisms involved in the development of traumatic stress adaptations correlate with diverse, interrelated psychiatric symptoms and comorbidities often reported in studies of individuals who have experienced repeated abuse and neglect. This notion is consistent with a socio-ecological framework, the developmental trauma diagnosis, and trans-theoretical models that focus on far-reaching (cross-diagnostic) effects from critical and sensitive periods, attachment and social cognition (e.g., mentalizing and perspective taking), sleep, physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and mood and personality (141–143). The role of attachment Prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers. According to attachment theorists, securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregivers to minimize anxiety and to form goal-directed partnerships, and/or interactional synchrony, where they mirror each other's communication patterns and learn to anticipate, express, and meet each other's needs. Through these interactions, children develop internal working models, which encompass individuals' core beliefs about their self-worth and lovability as well as their general expectations of others in relationships (144). Insecure attachment styles (e.g., anxious, avoidant, and disorganized) are frequently associated with interpersonal trauma (145–147). Studies have consistently linked attachment disturbances to the emergence (and maintenance) of developmental trauma symptoms, which may remain latent until interpersonal interactions later in life (e.g., peer conflicts, inadequate institutional responses to trauma, workplace challenges) give rise to memories of early trauma (148). The combination of repeated childhood trauma and the absence of parental nurturing, support, and protection (e.g., parents who are addicted to alcohol and/or drugs, are homeless, or are living in severe poverty; family violence; parental incarceration) can be particularly devastating and can potentiate DT (34, 145, 149, 150).Social cognition Cognitive science researchers have expanded upon attachment concepts to include the construct of mentalizing, which is defined as the capacity to consider the mental states of others (e.g., inferring their needs, goals, interests, and intersubjective experiences) as distinct from one's own. Mentalizing has been described in the literature as reflective functioning, theory of mind, metacognition, insight, and perspective-taking (151). Mentalizing deficits have been reported in several clinical populations, including individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and more recently, developmental traumas (152–155). Children and adolescents with DT demonstrate impaired mentalizing (i.e., reflecting functioning), referring to the capacity to effectively understand oneself (needs, strengths, and limitations) and others (e.g., that others may have worldviews that differ from one's own). Early interpersonal trauma and insecure attachment correlate with low reflective functioning (154, 156–158). Scholars have surmised that these children are likely dissociating (and therefore undermining their intra/interpersonal awareness), fearful and anxious, and preoccupied with maintaining compulsive and highly ritualistic behaviors (41, 159). For example, in response to sexual trauma, victims often report experiencing contamination anxiety such as body shame and disgust and overwhelming fear, that being near others will result in contact contamination (160–162). These individuals, in turn, engage in social avoidance, excessive cleansing, handwashing, and relentless reassurance-seeking to make sure they don't increase the likelihood of illness or misfortune in others.Executive functions and self-regulation capacities Executive functions refer to diverse cognitive abilities including working memory, mental flexibility, and information processing that regulate attention, mood, and behavior; enable adaptive, goal-focused actions; and are instrumental to effective coping, problem solving, and success in school, work, and relationships (163). Traumatic stress is known to cause measurable adverse effects on executive functions (121, 134, 164). For example, recent studies, including several meta-analyses, have found that trauma negatively correlates with working memory, inhibition, and mental flexibility; the adverse effects are often higher for children exposed to multiple traumas compared to those reporting isolated events (93, 165, 166). These executive functioning challenges often result in significant shifts in mood and energy that interfere with concentration, decision-making, and social-interpersonal functioning.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>PERSON<|>Researchers are individuals who study and analyze the effects of early trauma on cognitive disturbances in children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMYGDALA<|>GEO<|>The amygdala is a region of the brain involved in processing emotions and fear responses, which is affected by early trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIPPOCAMPUS<|>GEO<|>The hippocampus is a brain region critical for learning and memory, which can be altered due to early trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREFRONTAL CORTEX<|>GEO<|>The prefrontal cortex is involved in higher-order cognitive functions and is influenced by early traumatic experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Developmental trauma refers to the adverse effects experienced by children due to repeated abuse and neglect during critical developmental periods.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURE ATTACHMENT<|>EVENT<|>Secure attachment is a healthy emotional bond formed between a child and caregiver, which can be disrupted by trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>EVENT<|>Insecure attachment styles arise from trauma and negatively impact interpersonal relationships and emotional regulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTALIZING<|>EVENT<|>Mentalizing is the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others, which can be impaired in children with developmental trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Executive functions are cognitive processes that regulate behavior and are adversely affected by traumatic stress.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>AMYGDALA<|>Researchers study the amygdala's role in emotional processing and its alteration due to early trauma<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>HIPPOCAMPUS<|>Researchers analyze how early trauma affects the hippocampus and its role in learning and memory<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESEARCHERS<|>PREFRONTAL CORTEX<|>Researchers investigate the impact of trauma on the prefrontal cortex and its cognitive functions<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>SECURE ATTACHMENT<|>Developmental trauma disrupts the formation of secure attachments in children<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>Developmental trauma leads to the development of insecure attachment styles<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>MENTALIZING<|>Insecure attachment is linked to deficits in mentalizing abilities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS<|>Developmental trauma negatively impacts executive functions, affecting behavior regulation<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
