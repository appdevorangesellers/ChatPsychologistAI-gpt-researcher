The TQ was included as a disability module in the third round of the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and administered to almost 200,000 children across 18 countries (Gottlieb and others 2009). The TQ is a sensitive tool that identifies 80â€“100 percent of children with developmental disorders; however, it has a low specificity, necessitating a second stage to examine those children who screen positive (Durkin and others 1994).Box 8.2Ten Questions Screen. Compared with other children, did the child have any serious delay in sitting, standing, or walking? Compared with other children, does the child have difficulty seeing, either in the daytime or night?Administration of the ACCESS portfolio provides screening of children with developmental disorders, as well as simple advice to parents. Community health workers (CHWs) in Sri Lanka and Uganda used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children younger than age three years whose mothers had expressed concerns. The CHWsâ€™ assessments of delay had an 82 percent accuracy in children older than age two years, compared with those identified by medical or allied health staff, although the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument were not measured. The ACCESS portfolio raised awareness of developmental disorders in communities, and CHWs and parents reported it to be helpful (Wirz and others 2005).Two significant issues arise following the identification of children with developmental disorders. The first involves the stigma associated with these diagnoses in some countries and cultures. The second is the limited evidence for the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation for children with intellectual disabilities and autism in LMICs. These issues do not necessarily indicate that interventions are ineffective, but rather that further evaluation is required (Hastings, Robertson, and Yasamy 2012; Robertson and others 2012).Parenting Skills TrainingParenting skills training aims to enhance or support the parental role through education and training, thereby improving emotional and behavioral outcomes for children. A meta-analysis identified four components of parenting skills training that were particularly effective. Increasing positive parent-child interactions, teaching parents how to communicate emotionally with their children, teaching parents the use of time out as a means of discipline, and supporting parents to consistently respond to their childrenâ€™s behaviors had the largest effects on reducing externalizing behaviors in children (Kaminski and others 2008).Several systematic reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of parenting skills training in reducing internalizing and externalizing problems in children (Furlong and others 2013; Kaminski and others 2008), as well as in reducing the risk of unintentional childhood injuries (Kendrick and others 2007) and improving the mental health of parents (Barlow and others 2014). Childhood disruptive and externalizing behaviors may persist into adolescence, affecting peers, schools, and communities (Fergusson, Horwood, and Lynskey 1994). Furthermore, although many externalizing behaviors diminish as individuals mature through adolescence, life course persistence of antisocial behaviors is more likely in those with childhood-onset conduct problems (Moffitt and others 2002). A meta-analysis of group-based parenting skills training for parents of children with conduct problems showed moderate effect sizes with a standardized mean difference in conduct problems of â€“0.53 (95 percent confidence interval [CI]: â€“0.72 to â€“0.34) as assessed by parents (Furlong and others 2013). Therefore, parenting skills interventions can reduce or prevent the onset of childhood mental disorders and subsequent adverse health and social outcomes.The evidence for the effectiveness of parenting skills training comes from studies conducted in HICs (Furlong and others 2013). A systematic review of parenting interventions in LMICs reported that most studies examined educational or physical outcomes (Mejia, Calam, and Sanders 2012). However, eight studies examined interventions to prevent or reduce emotional and behavioral problems in children. The following outcomes were assessed:Infant attachment (Cooper and others 2009)Maternal understanding and attitude about child development (Jin and others 2007; Klein and Rye 2004; Rahman and others 2009)Mother-child interaction (Klein and Rye 2004; Wendland-Carro, Piccinini, and Millar 1999)Child abuse (Aracena and others 2009; Oveisi and others 2010)Reductions in child behavioral problems (Fayyad and others 2010).The mean effect size of the parenting skills training across the eight studies was large (Cohenâ€™s d = 0.81) (Mejia, Calam, and Sanders 2012); benefits persisted in the follow-up studies, which were as long as 18 months in a study in South Africa (Cooper and others 2009) and six years in a study in Ethiopia (Klein and Rye 2004). Thus, emerging evidence from available research suggests parenting skills training is a feasible and effective intervention in LMICs. The extensive research base available from HICs requires integration with knowledge acquired from studies conducted in LMICs for the development of culturally appropriate parenting skills training.Maternal Mental Health InterventionsPoor maternal mental health is a risk factor for childrenâ€™s physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development (Deave and others 2008; Feldman and others 2009; Glasheen, Richardson, and Fabio 2010; Grace, Evindar, and Stewart 2003; Grigoriadis and others 2013; Grote and others 2010; Hamadani and others 2012; Wachs, Black, and Engle 2009; Wan and others 2007); the impact continues into adolescence and adulthood (Murray and others 2011\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS CHILDRENâ€™S FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF) is a UN agency that provides humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide, including conducting surveys to assess child development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ACCESS portfolio is a tool used by community health workers to screen children for developmental disorders and provide advice to parents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SRI LANKA<|>GEO<|>Sri Lanka is a country where community health workers used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children for developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UGANDA<|>GEO<|>Uganda is another country where community health workers utilized the ACCESS portfolio for assessing children's developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING<|>EVENT<|>Parenting skills training is an intervention aimed at enhancing parental roles through education and training to improve children's emotional and behavioral outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LMICs<|>GEO<|>Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) are regions where parenting skills training interventions are being evaluated for effectiveness.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HICs<|>GEO<|>High-Income Countries (HICs) are regions where extensive research on parenting skills training has been conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Maternal mental health interventions are programs aimed at improving the mental health of mothers to positively impact their children's development.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>UNITED NATIONS CHILDRENâ€™S FUND<|>The ACCESS portfolio was included as a disability module in UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to assess children's developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SRI LANKA<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>Community health workers in Sri Lanka used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children for developmental disorders<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UGANDA<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>Community health workers in Uganda utilized the ACCESS portfolio for assessing children's developmental disorders<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING<|>LMICs<|>Parenting skills training interventions are being evaluated for effectiveness in LMICs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING<|>HICs<|>Extensive research on parenting skills training has been conducted in HICs, providing a basis for interventions in LMICs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS<|>LMICs<|>Maternal mental health interventions are important in LMICs to mitigate risks to children's development<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
