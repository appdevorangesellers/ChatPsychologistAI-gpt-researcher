Financial difficulties are the result of many factors, only some of which are under your control. Reminding yourself that your finances do not define you as a person can reduce feelings of sadness, shame or guilt. 4. Take care of yourself It’s draining dealing with ongoing financial stress. So focus on self-care and coping strategies that have helped you with past stressors. This may mean taking some time out to relax, deep breathing or meditation, talking with others and doing some things for fun. Giving yourself permission to take this time can improve your mood, perspective and wellbeing. 5. Ask for help If you are struggling financially or psychologically, seek help. This may take the form of financial advice or assistance to reduce financial difficulties. If you notice yourself feeling persistently down, anxious, or hopeless, reach out to friends or family and get help from a mental health professional.

Some people are struggling to pay bills, feed the family, or maintain a place to live. Others are meeting their basic needs but are dipping into their savings for extras. Financial stress is increasing and, understandably, is causing some distress. In recent months, Lifeline has seen a rise in the number of calls about financial difficulties. But understanding and finding ways to reduce our financial stress – and its emotional impact on us – can help make this challenging time a bit easier. Read more: What's taking the biggest toll on our mental health? Disconnection, financial stress and long waits for care What is financial stress? If you’re finding it difficult to meet your current expenses or are worried about your current or future finances, you’re under financial stress. Like other types of stress, financial stress has two components: objective financial difficulty, where you don’t have enough funds to cover necessary expenses or debts subjective perceptions about your current or future finances, leading to worry and distress. These two are related. But someone can have trouble meeting their expenses, view this as acceptable, and not be overly worried. Alternatively, someone may be reasonably financially secure but still feel quite stressed about their finances. Read more: Stress is a health hazard. But a supportive circle of friends can help undo the damaging effects on your DNA Why are we feeling it? There is a broad range of factors that can influence your current level of financial stress. These include contextual and personal ones. Contextual factors are societal-level influences on the current financial landscape. These include rates of economic growth, market performance, governmental and political policy, and distribution of wealth. These factors may vary across cultures and countries. Personal factors contributing to stress are unique to each person. For example, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education and ethnic group may influence someone’s access to financial resources. Other personal factors that can affect financial stress are financial literacy and practices, personality traits that influence behaviour and perceptions, and major life events with financial implications (such as marriage, having a child, or retiring). Not all factors contributing to your financial stress are under your control.

A review found clear evidence for a link between financial stress and depression, and that the risk for depression was greatest for people on low incomes. A large survey of adults in the United States also found that greater financial worries were associated with more psychological distress. This was especially the case for people who were unmarried, unemployed, had lower income levels and who were renters. So people who are more vulnerable financially – in an objective sense – are also most likely to experience negative psychological effects from financial stress. However, the perception of your financial situation matters here too. In one study of older adults, including Australians, it was not just someone’s financial situation that was linked to their wellbeing, but also how satisfied people were with their wealth. Severe financial stressors, such as being forced to sell your home if unable to meet mortgage payments, can affect both psychological and physical health.
