The Nature of Trauma Traumatic events can take various forms, such as accidents, natural disasters, abuse, assault, or the sudden loss of a loved one. These experiences can be overwhelming and may leave an individual feeling helpless, vulnerable, and emotionally shattered. The impact of trauma is not limited to the immediate aftermath of the event but can continue to affect an individual’s mental health for years or even decades.

Depression can lead to physical symptoms, such as fatigue and sleep disturbances, and may increase the risk of suicide.
