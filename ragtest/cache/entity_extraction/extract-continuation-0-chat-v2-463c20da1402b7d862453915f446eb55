As Sue et al. (2007) have noted: “…microagressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults” (p. 273). The extensive research on microaggressions provides powerful examples of how daily indignities are often embedded in narratives of historical oppression and trauma so as to serve as reminders and continuations of past oppression and trauma (Michaels, 2010).Narrative Salience Figure 1 also depicts how historical trauma narratives may be more or less salient to an individual or community. Should a person not experience nor perceive any present impact of historical trauma, a narrative of trauma will not have as much meaning to them, even if they are aware of that history. Present conditions and experiences are what make historical trauma narratives relevant to the present and future. Conversely, if a historical trauma narrative is highly salient and accessible to an individual, present conditions and daily indignities also become more readily apparent as part of the historical trauma narrative. Just as dominant cultural narratives serve as reminders of historical traumas, family and community narratives of resilience, action, and aspiration can provide a counter-weight to oppressive dominant cultural narratives (Rappaport & Simkins, 1991). Symbols of marginalization bring to life the traumas in historical trauma narratives (Evans-Campbell, 2008; Simms, 2008), whereas symbols of resistance and persistence bring to life messages of resilience and well-being (Denham, 2008; Fullilove, 1996).Health Impacts Finally, the figure also shows how narrative salience influences health impacts. Although Brave Heart (2003) emphasizes psychological distress as a common historical trauma response, as noted previously, other scholars have identified a range of negative health outcomes in response to historical trauma. For example, authors working with diverse populations throughout the world link historical traumas to such contemporary sequelae as predisposition to PTSD (Karenian et al., 2011; Kellermann, 2001b); symptoms of anxiety and depression, with a preponderance of shame and fear (Carolina Lopez, 2011; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Whitbeck et al., 2009); and disruptions to family and parent-child relationships (Bar-On et al., 1998; Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011). Similarly, numerous authors use historical trauma as an explanatory framework for understanding a wide-range of health disparities with psychological, social, and biological mechanisms (Crawford, 2013; Daley, 2006; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Sotero, 2006; Walters et al., 2011). Despite this range of potential health impacts, Gone (2013) emphasizes that the development of the notion of historical trauma originates out of the psychological literature, and therefore most discussions of historical trauma preference negative behavioral health impacts. Further, as summarized earlier, health impacts may exemplify wound and survival, trauma and resilience (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008).Illustrations of the Model Narratives of loss and resilience Historical trauma narratives do not always offer a clear path to either wounding or resilience, but instead may indicate both of these responses simultaneously. For example, among many indigenous groups around the world, the history of being colonized forms a common narrative that includes being displaced from traditional land and resources, physically and culturally slaughtered, and portrayed by the dominant culture as uncivilized and less evolved (Duran, 2006). This narrative presents a history of trauma, including disease, warfare, colonization, cultural genocide, and poverty, yet it is also a story of ongoing resistance (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011)—it is a history of devastation and survival. Native American reservations in the U.S. and the coerced resettlement of Inuit into government towns in Canada serve as powerful examples of how historical trauma narratives can simultaneously manifest a sense of loss and resilience. This history carries a legacy of imprisonment—with reservations and government settlements serving as ongoing symbols of confinement and loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Conversely, these communities are also sites of resilience, where indigenous peoples maintain traditional family structures and provide rich enculturation (Walters, Simoni, & Evans-Campbell, 2002). Thus, reservations and government settlements serve a dual function—as reminders of loss as well as places that sustain cultural identity and continuity. A similar narrative of loss and resilience is found in Abramowitz’s (2005) description of how the public narratives of communities in the Guinean Languette after attacks on their villages resulted in varying post-traumatic symptoms. Those villages that created narratives of group trauma that stressed community persistence and the survival of cultural systems had lower rates of post-traumatic symptoms; in contrast, villages with public narratives that emphasized the destruction of the community’s local moral world exhibited higher post-conflict symptoms (Abramowitz, 2005). This example also illustrates two related observations about narratives of loss and resilience: 1) how the wide variation in public narratives about trauma may result in markedly varying health impacts, and 2) how varying health impacts may be observed despite common traumatic experiences. Examples of public narratives emblematic of loss and resilience are also evident in the experiences of other historically oppressed cultural groups, including descendants of the Armenian genocide during the Ottoman Empire, descendants of Stalinist persecution in Russian, African American, and aboriginal or indigenous peoples across the world. It is not uncommon for these narratives to include experiences of genocide, forced relocation, enslavement, and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; often alongside narratives of resistance, survival,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological wounds experienced by a group due to historical oppression and trauma, affecting their present and future experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS<|>GEO<|>Native American reservations in the U.S. are areas of land managed by Native American tribes, serving as symbols of both loss and resilience in the context of historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INUIT GOVERNMENT TOWNS<|>GEO<|>Government towns in Canada where Inuit peoples were coerced to resettle, representing both confinement and cultural continuity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>GEO<|>A region in Guinea that experienced attacks on villages, leading to varying post-traumatic symptoms based on community narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>EVENT<|>The Armenian genocide refers to the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, creating a historical narrative of trauma for descendants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>EVENT<|>Stalinist persecution refers to the political repression and mass killings in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, impacting the descendants of those affected.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>GEO<|>The African American community in the U.S. has a historical narrative shaped by slavery, segregation, and ongoing discrimination, influencing their collective identity and resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL GENOCIDE<|>EVENT<|>Cultural genocide involves the systematic destruction of a group's culture, often through policies that erase their traditions, languages, and identities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Native American reservations serve as reminders of historical trauma while also being sites of cultural resilience and identity preservation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INUIT GOVERNMENT TOWNS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Inuit government towns symbolize the historical trauma of forced resettlement while also maintaining cultural continuity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The experiences of communities in the Guinean Languette illustrate how narratives of trauma can influence health outcomes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Armenian genocide is a significant historical trauma that shapes the identity and narratives of its descendants<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Stalinist persecution represents a historical trauma that affects the descendants of those who suffered under the regime<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The African American community's historical narrative of trauma influences their collective identity and resilience<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL GENOCIDE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Cultural genocide is a form of historical trauma that impacts the identity and continuity of affected groups<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
