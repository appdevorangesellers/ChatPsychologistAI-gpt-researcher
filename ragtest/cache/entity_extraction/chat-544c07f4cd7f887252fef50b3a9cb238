A new conceptualization of trauma—specifically the construct of complex trauma—was developed for repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents who often have high comorbidities between trauma and other disorders, which are underestimated by PTSD diagnostic criteria (29–31).\nFrom this perspective, the diagnosis of PTSD only accounts for a limited portion of the symptoms experienced by individuals who have experienced childhood trauma. These individuals often demonstrate broader and more severe health problems, social and economic adversity (including poverty and homelessness, psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration), and medical and psychiatric comorbidities as well as persistent negative views of themselves, others, and their life circumstances (32–34). In addition, they may re-enact their traumas through defensive (protective) expressions of anger and aggression (because they fear emotional vulnerability and experiencing additional traumas) and by coping with alcohol, drugs, and self-inflicted injuries to numb their emotional pain and suffering (35).\nThe differing presentations of trauma-related disorders that span a wide range of medical and psychological comorbidities frequently go unnoticed with classical PTSD diagnostic approaches, and, therefore, are often underreported and, in turn, untreated (36). Individuals who have experienced prolonged, repeated interpersonal traumas often present with overlapping symptoms of PTSD and a multiplicity of mental health conditions such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD, including late-onset in adulthood), autism spectrum disorders (ASD, including social-communication disturbances), psychosis, and mood and personality disorders (37–42).\nComplex post-traumatic stress disorder\nThe conceptualization of complex trauma emphasizes prolonged and unavoidable circumstances, regardless of one's age. Compared to those with PTSD, patients with complex PTSD (c-PTSD) consistently report cumulative traumas, including interpersonal violence exposure and sexual abuse (30, 43–50). c-PTSD has been studied extensively in diverse samples, including racial and sexual minorities as well as human trafficking victims who have experienced repeated physical and sexual assault (51–54). Nevertheless, more studies of children with c-PTSD are needed [i.e., (55)].\nAdolescents and adults who have experienced trauma and developed measurable mental health symptoms, as a result, may present with indications of c-PTSD that warrant careful diagnostic evaluation. As defined by ICD-11 criteria, the symptoms of c-PTSD are characterized by three PTSD symptom clusters: (1) persistent and intrusive thoughts, (2) hyperarousal (i.e., heightened startle in response to unexpected sounds or movements), and (3) deliberate avoidance of trauma reminders. c-PTSD is differentiated by a second higher-order measurement factor, characterized by disturbances in self-organization (DSO), which encompasses affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and pervasive disturbances in relationships (56–58).\nDSO is also highly prevalent in patients with borderline personality disorder [BPD; (59)]. More specifically, c-PTSD and BPD have overlapping symptoms of anxiety sensitivity, low psychological distress tolerance, dissociation, and relational problems originating from attachment insecurities and, in clinical contexts, parataxic distortions whereby patients re-enact interpersonal behaviors with healthcare providers that mirror past relationships (60–63). However, empirical findings suggest that BPD only accounts for a limited portion of the symptoms reported by individuals who have experienced childhood trauma and that characteristics of c-PTSD and BPD correlate with, and are distinct from, several other psychiatric disorders such as unipolar and bipolar depression, substance abuse, and functional neurological disorders [e.g., (59, 64–68)].\nDevelopmental trauma: An overview\nDevelopmental Trauma (DT) refers to the complex and pervasive exposure to life-threatening events that (1) occurs through sensitive periods of infant and child development, (2) disrupts interpersonal attachments, (3) compromises an individual's safety and security operations, (4) alters foundational capacities for cognitive, behavioral, and emotional control, and (5) often contributes to the development of complex PTSD in adulthood (69–74). DTD emerges from prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma that disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers and dramatically alters core assumptions and beliefs about one's vulnerability to danger in the world. DTD is theorized to develop from early interpersonal trauma. However, DTD may also result from the lack of a secure attachment relationship, which would have protected the developing individual during early trauma events. For example, a child who, within the context of a securely attached relationship with their caregiver, is exposed to abuse is likely to fare more positively than one who is exposed to the same abuse, yet lacks a secure attachment. The diagnosis of DTD was proposed for inclusion in the DSM-5 as an alternative to PTSD to better address the timing in which traumatic events occur (e.g., during sensitive periods of brain development) and the impacts on children's self-regulation skills and relational capacities (75). DTD attempts to provide this differentiation by underscoring experiences of pervasive, complex traumas that occurred early in life for children, and for adults whose physical, psychological, social and emotional disturbances originated from these experiences, which may be repeatedly interfering with their relationships, quality of life, self-identity, and life satisfaction.\nDT has been postulated to result in symptoms that extend beyond those of PTSD and that often occur when traumatized children and adolescents are exposed to developmental trauma(s). These symptoms may complicate or, in some cases, account for the mental health problems that lead to the diagnosis of several childhood/adolescent psychiatric disorders. This has been confirmed in a number of large-scale field trials, cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations, and comparative studies spanning diverse psychiatric groups (24, 31, 76, 77). It has been suggested that DTD is set apart from PTSD in that the former is precipitated by toxic stress, referring to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
