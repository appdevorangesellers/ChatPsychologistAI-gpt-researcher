Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders Research into the genetics, neuroscience, and neuroimaging of anxiety disorders supports differences in heritability of disorders that are based on fear (phobias), obsessions and compulsions, dissociation, and trauma. The DSM-5, therefore, has assigned a separate chapter to each of these groups of anxiety disorders. The trauma- and stressor-related disorders group includes several diagnoses, defined somewhat differently than in DSM-IV, including reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder, that have significant implications for children and adolescents and for forensic practice. Forensic mental health experts may be asked to comment on the quality or consequences of attachment in cases involving child welfare services, child custody and adoption, juvenile delinquency, criminal responsibility, and capital sentencing, where attachment between the defendant and his caretaker may be presented as an aggravating or a mitigating factor. Disorders associated with social neglect (e.g., deficient caretaking during childhood, especially during the first months of life) may result in deficits in parent-child attachment. However, the trauma- and stressor-related disorders section of DSM-5 contains an advisory about assessing attachment in individuals who are from cultures in which attachment has not been studied; the diagnosis should be assigned with caution. The Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders group also includes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). DSM-5 provides a list of diagnostic criteria that are specific to children six years of age or younger that describes reenactment of trauma in play and dissociative responses to trauma. The difficulty of determining whether recurring distressing dreams in young children are related to traumatic incidents is also discussed. In children and adolescents, the symptoms in Criterion E for PTSD, including marked alterations in arousal and reactivity, such as irritable behavior, angry outbursts without much provocation, and self-destructive behavior (thrill-seeking, high-risk behavior, and reckless behavior leading to accidental harm to self or others) (Ref. 1, p 272), may result in referrals to mental health professionals, especially in justice-involved youths. The diagnostic criteria will facilitate identification of aggressive youths who may benefit from evidence-based clinical interventions for PTSD. This is particularly important in Latino, Native American, and African American youths, who have higher rates of PTSD, even after adjusting for demographic factors and exposure to trauma (Ref. 1, p 276). These youths also are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system. However, cultural sensitivity is a requirement when diagnosing PTSD, especially when a forensic psychiatrist is evaluating a child from another country where he may have been exposed to various traumas and is struggling to acculturate. The changes in the PTSD diagnostic criteria may increase the likelihood that child forensic psychiatrists will be asked to testify about PTSD and aggression in school, special education, individualized education programs (IEPs), and expulsion hearings and in juvenile court waiver or bindover and disposition or sentencing hearings. When youths who have been exposed to severe trauma engage in aggressive, risky, or thrill-seeking behavior and appear to be callous and unemotional, judicial administrators may want to know whether the history of traumatization is contributing to the behavior and warrants mental health intervention. Child forensic psychiatrists may be increasingly retained to examine this question and to recommend therapeutic interventions for affected individuals. Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Conduct disorder is one of the only diagnoses in the DSM-5 that contains no exclusionary criteria for other clinically treatable diagnoses, and consequently, it may lend itself to diagnosis by lay persons who lack facility with clinical diagnoses. The diagnosis, which can also be made in adults, requires the affected individual to meet 3 of 15 criteria in one of four categories: aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violation of rules. One specifier, with limited prosocial emotions, merits further discussion. Individuals with limited prosocial emotions meet two of the following four criteria: lack of remorse or guilt about their behavior until they are caught; lack of empathy; seeming unconcerned about consequences of unsatisfactory academic, professional, or other achievement; and “shallow or deficient affect” (Ref. 1, p 471). These youths often misuse substances and have a higher rate of suicidal ideation and attempted and completed suicides (Ref. 1, p 473). The behavioral description of conduct disorder overlaps considerably with the behavior exhibited by individuals with psychosis, mood disorders, and PTSD. Also, many youths with conduct disorder become involved in the juvenile justice system, where the prevalence of mental disorders is higher than in the general population, even when conduct disorder is excluded.26 Perception of the limited prosocial emotions specifier has not been studied in juvenile court judges. However, when conduct disorder with callous and unemotional features was studied in mental health professionals who evaluate justice-involved youths, the response was both negative and punitive. This outcome has led to concerns about the influence of this specifier on mental health professionals and on the jurists and attorneys to whom they provide expert consultation.27 The facility with which the conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions diagnosis can be made increases the likelihood that other treatable diagnoses may be overlooked, as often happens when mental health services in juvenile corrections facilities are reviewed.28,29 The concern extends to youths charged with more serious offenses, whose cases are bound over or waived from juvenile to criminal court. These individuals tend to have more serious mental disorders than youths whose cases remain in the juvenile court system.30 Although defense attorneys have concerns about the adjudicative competence of youths who seem to lack the maturity to understand the legal process and to assist in their defense,31 immaturity is not considered a mental disease or defect for purposes of adjudicative incompetence.32 Juveniles also are more likely than adults to make false confessions.33 Consequently, in the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association that provides standardized criteria for the classification of mental disorders, including anxiety disorders and trauma-related disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA- AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>A category of mental health disorders in the DSM-5 that includes diagnoses related to trauma and stress, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reactive attachment disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD WELFARE SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Child welfare services are government and non-profit organizations that work to protect children and ensure their well-being, often involved in cases of child custody and adoption.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The juvenile justice system is a legal framework that deals with minors who have been accused of committing crimes, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATINO YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>Latino youths are young individuals of Latin American descent who may experience higher rates of PTSD and are often involved in the juvenile justice system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>Native American youths are young individuals belonging to Native American tribes, who also show higher rates of PTSD and are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>African American youths are young individuals of African descent, facing higher rates of PTSD and involvement in the juvenile justice system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>PERSON<|>Child forensic psychiatrists are mental health professionals who evaluate children involved in legal cases, often assessing the impact of trauma on behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Conduct disorder is a mental health diagnosis characterized by a pattern of behavior that violates societal norms and the rights of others, often seen in youths.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>TRAUMA- AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS<|>The DSM-5 categorizes trauma- and stressor-related disorders, providing diagnostic criteria for these conditions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILD WELFARE SERVICES<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>Child welfare services often intersect with the juvenile justice system in cases involving child custody and protection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LATINO YOUTHS<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>Latino youths are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, often facing higher rates of PTSD<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>Native American youths are also disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, experiencing higher rates of PTSD<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>African American youths face higher rates of PTSD and are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>TRAUMA- AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS<|>Child forensic psychiatrists may evaluate the impact of trauma on youths with trauma- and stressor-related disorders<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>Conduct disorder is frequently diagnosed in youths who become involved in the juvenile justice system<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
