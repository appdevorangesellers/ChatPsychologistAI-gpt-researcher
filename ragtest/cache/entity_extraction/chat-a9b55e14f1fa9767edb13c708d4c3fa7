As defined by ICD-11 criteria, the symptoms of c-PTSD are characterized by three PTSD symptom clusters: (1) persistent and intrusive thoughts, (2) hyperarousal (i.e., heightened startle in response to unexpected sounds or movements), and (3) deliberate avoidance of trauma reminders. c-PTSD is differentiated by a second higher-order measurement factor, characterized by disturbances in self-organization (DSO), which encompasses affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and pervasive disturbances in relationships (56–58). DSO is also highly prevalent in patients with borderline personality disorder [BPD; (59)]. More specifically, c-PTSD and BPD have overlapping symptoms of anxiety sensitivity, low psychological distress tolerance, dissociation, and relational problems originating from attachment insecurities and, in clinical contexts, parataxic distortions whereby patients re-enact interpersonal behaviors with healthcare providers that mirror past relationships (60–63). However, empirical findings suggest that BPD only accounts for a limited portion of the symptoms reported by individuals who have experienced childhood trauma and that characteristics of c-PTSD and BPD correlate with, and are distinct from, several other psychiatric disorders such as unipolar and bipolar depression, substance abuse, and functional neurological disorders [e.g., (59, 64–68)].Developmental trauma: An overview Developmental Trauma (DT) refers to the complex and pervasive exposure to life-threatening events that (1) occurs through sensitive periods of infant and child development, (2) disrupts interpersonal attachments, (3) compromises an individual's safety and security operations, (4) alters foundational capacities for cognitive, behavioral, and emotional control, and (5) often contributes to the development of complex PTSD in adulthood (69–74). DTD emerges from prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma that disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers and dramatically alters core assumptions and beliefs about one's vulnerability to danger in the world. DTD is theorized to develop from early interpersonal trauma. However, DTD may also result from the lack of a secure attachment relationship, which would have protected the developing individual during early trauma events. For example, a child who, within the context of a securely attached relationship with their caregiver, is exposed to abuse is likely to fare more positively than one who is exposed to the same abuse, yet lacks a secure attachment. The diagnosis of DTD was proposed for inclusion in the DSM-5 as an alternative to PTSD to better address the timing in which traumatic events occur (e.g., during sensitive periods of brain development) and the impacts on children's self-regulation skills and relational capacities (75). DTD attempts to provide this differentiation by underscoring experiences of pervasive, complex traumas that occurred early in life for children, and for adults whose physical, psychological, social and emotional disturbances originated from these experiences, which may be repeatedly interfering with their relationships, quality of life, self-identity, and life satisfaction. DT has been postulated to result in symptoms that extend beyond those of PTSD and that often occur when traumatized children and adolescents are exposed to developmental trauma(s). These symptoms may complicate or, in some cases, account for the mental health problems that lead to the diagnosis of several childhood/adolescent psychiatric disorders. This has been confirmed in a number of large-scale field trials, cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations, and comparative studies spanning diverse psychiatric groups (24, 31, 76, 77). It has been suggested that DTD is set apart from PTSD in that the former is precipitated by toxic stress, referring to prolonged activation of the stress response system, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in the absence of treatments and supportive peers and adults (78, 79). In addition, attachment disturbances associated with DTD originate at the beginning of an individual's lifespan development (e.g., parental neglect and abandonment, parents addicted to alcohol and drugs, separation from caregivers. By comparison, the causal events that lead to PTSD can occur at any point (or points) in one's life cycle. Investigations of individuals with DTD suggest that developmental trauma is often characterized by (1) poor self-identity development, (2) interpersonal sensitivity and consistent problems in relationships, including with peers, adults, and primary caregivers, (3) high rates of exposure to family and community violence, (4) high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, and (5) chronic and debilitating medical/neurological illnesses (24, 28, 34, 36, 80–82). Indeed, several studies have confirmed high comorbidities between PTSD and other disorders including depression, anxiety and panic/agoraphobia, psychotic disorders, and functional medical syndromes that might warrant differentiated assessment procedures and treatments (83–85). Studies of children living in pervasively abusive and neglectful circumstances indicate that children with characteristics of DTD commonly (often exclusively) rely on behavioral inhibition and cognitive dissociation; these responses are mediated by conditioned fear and physiological hypoarousal [i.e., the freezing adaptation of the stress response system; (86)]. Numerous studies suggest that individuals with complex traumas and DTD tend to cope with their traumas by deliberately evading reminders of the original trauma and by denying that such events occurred, including on self-report trauma symptom measures (87, 88), thereby conferring additive risks (i.e., dissociation and traumatic amnesia, undermining mental health needs). These traumatic stress adaptations, in turn, can contribute to experiences of emotional numbing and low frustration tolerance and precipitate behavioral outbursts that result in refractory (treatment-resistant) mood disturbances, long-term psychiatric hospitalizations (and re-hospitalizations), removal from school, and placement in foster care and juvenile justice treatment centers (89–93).
