Emotion dysregulation is the inability to use healthy strategies to diffuse or moderate negative emotions. It is common for people to occasionally use less-than-ideal emotional regulation strategies. However, individuals who regularly experience overwhelming, intense, negative emotions are much more likely to rely on unhealthy strategies. Imagine a scenario where one of your friends does not turn up for a pre-arranged lunch with you. Instead of considering the many reasonable explanations for why this happened, this event can trigger feelings of hurt or abandonment for someone with emotional dysregulation. They may feel intense anger or resentment, resulting in acting on these emotions, such as shouting at the friend, accusing them of being a bad friend, or withdrawing from the friendship. In a distressing situation, someone with inadequate emotion regulation skills experiences distress related to negative emotions and a lack of control over their emotions. When acting on our dysregulated emotions, we can end up behaving in ways that overwhelm us further, meaning we can get stuck in a vicious emotional cycle. Dysregulation lies on a spectrum between underregulated and overregulated styles. Both make it hard to self-soothe and return to baseline emotional states. Someone with dysregulated emotions may: Have reduced awareness and understanding of their emotions Have the inability to inhibit impulsive behaviors Have heightened, labile negative emotions Have a high sensitivity to emotions in a social context Some of the common behaviors of someone with emotion dysregulation include: Dissociating Numbing Rage Violent outbursts Impulsive, reckless behavior Substance abuse Avoidance Self-injurious behaviors What causes poor emotional regulation? Having poor emotional regulation often comes from childhood. Below are some possible causes for why someone may struggle with regulating their emotions: Temperament A temperament is mainly determined by genetic inheritance and is usually stable across time and situations. It may be possible that some children develop poor emotional regulation due to their temperament. Differences in temperament can be observable very early in life. Some infants are calm and even-tempered, while others tend to have more intense and longer stress reactions which may contribute to poorer emotional regulation. Trauma Trauma is described as the experience of catastrophic affect an individual cannot process, understand, and/or integrate. The overwhelming intensity of feelings can automatically freeze or shut down consciousness. Many people who experience trauma, especially as a child, are likely to have poor emotional regulation. Someone who experiences trauma may have inflexible strategies to help with emotions â€“ often one way of reacting to negative emotions. The more trauma someone has experienced as a child, such as experiencing or witnessing abuse, the more likely they are to have severe emotional dysregulation. Attachment styles Early attachment experiences shape emotion regulation abilities. Infants need caregivers to help modulate their affects through attuned bonding. Without this, children fail to develop self-soothing capacities and instead rely on external regulation. Insecure attachment styles involve suboptimal parental attunement. Caregivers may be inconsistent, unavailable, extreme, or invalidating. Children internalize these dynamics, learning unhealthy regulation habits like suppression or dramatic emotionality. The encoded patterns persist into adulthood as emotion dysregulation. Low emotional intelligence Low emotional intelligence (EI) can lead to poor emotion regulation in several ways: Limited Recognition: Those with low EI may not accurately recognize their emotions, making it hard to address them appropriately. Misunderstanding Emotions: Without understanding the causes or triggers of emotions, itâ€™s difficult to strategize how to handle them. Impulsive Reactions: Low EI can result in knee-jerk emotional reactions without thoughtful response or self-reflection. Difficulty in Expression: People with low EI might struggle to express their emotions constructively, leading to miscommunication or conflict. Reduced Empathy: A lack of EI can mean reduced empathy for others, making interpersonal conflict more likely and harder to resolve. Ineffective Coping Strategies: Without the insight provided by higher EI, individuals might resort to maladaptive strategies like avoidance, substance abuse, or aggression. Related disorders Poor emotion regulation in childhood may increase the likelihood of developing other mental health disorders. Likewise, having a neurodevelopmental condition may come with symptoms associated with poorer emotional regulation. The following conditions can involve some difficulties with emotional regulation: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) People with this disorder often have emotional sensitivity, heightened and changeable negative moods, a deficit of appropriate regulation strategies, and a surplus of maladaptive regulation strategies. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) This condition is often diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced trauma such as violence, neglect, or abuse. In CPTSD, emotion regulation involves difficulty self-calming when distressed and chronic emotional numbing. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) This childhood condition can involve experiencing extreme moods and intense temper outbursts. There is often a lot of anger with this condition, irritability, and strong behaviors in response to negative emotions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) Poor emotional regulation is a common symptom of autism. Individuals often have greater or more intense baseline levels of negative emotions or irritability, have poorer problem-solving skills, can become easily overstimulated, and may find it harder to detect other peopleâ€™s emotions. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Poor emotional regulation is a key symptom of ADHD. Individuals with this disorder may have strong reactions to small setbacks, feel their emotions more intensely than others, have difficulty calming down, and have a low tolerance for frustration or annoyance. The cycle of distress Wanting to minimize or avoid strong and negative emotions is part of what is often called a â€˜cycle of shame.â€™ This pattern often looks like the Experimental Avoidance Model by Chapman, Gratz, & Brown (2006). This model explains that self-harm is primarily maintained by negative reinforcement in the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
