PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC4001826 NIHMSID: NIHMS569976 PMID: 24561774 The publisher's version of this article is available at Soc Sci Med Abstract Theories of historical trauma increasingly appear in the literature on individual and community health, especially in relation to racial and ethnic minority populations and groups that experience significant health disparities. As a consequence of this rapid growth, the literature on historical trauma comprises disparate terminology and research approaches. This critical review integrates this literature in order to specify theoretical mechanisms that explain how historical trauma influences the health of individuals and communities. We argue that historical trauma functions as a public narrative for particular groups or communities that connects present-day experiences and circumstances to the trauma so as to influence health. Treating historical trauma as a public narrative shifts the research discourse away from an exclusive search for past causal variables that influence health to identifying how present-day experiences, their corresponding narratives, and their health impacts are connected to public narratives of historical trauma for a particular group or community. We discuss how the connection between historical trauma and present-day experiences, related narratives, and health impacts may function as a source of present-day distress as well as resilience. Keywords: Historical trauma, personal narratives, public narratives, resilience, community healthIntroduction Historical trauma refers to a complex and collective trauma experienced over time and across generations by a group of people who share an identity, affiliation, or circumstance (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Crawford, 2013; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Gone, 2013). Although historical trauma was originally introduced to describe the experience of children of Holocaust survivors (Kellermann, 2001a), in the past two decades, the term has been applied to numerous colonized indigenous groups throughout the world, as well as African Americans, Armenian refugees, Japanese American survivors of intern\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATHANIEL VINCENT MOHATT<|>PERSON<|>Nathaniel Vincent Mohatt is an author affiliated with the Division of Prevention & Community Research at Yale University School of Medicine, focusing on historical trauma and its impact on health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE B THOMPSON<|>PERSON<|>Azure B Thompson is an author affiliated with the Division of Prevention & Community Research at Yale University School of Medicine, contributing to research on historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGHI D THAI<|>PERSON<|>Nghi D Thai is an author affiliated with the Department of Psychological Science at Central Connecticut State University, involved in research related to historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>PERSON<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes is an author affiliated with the Division of Prevention & Community Research at Yale University School of Medicine, focusing on historical trauma and community health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yale University School of Medicine is an academic institution where research on historical trauma and its effects on health is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Central Connecticut State University is an academic institution where research related to psychological science and historical trauma is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the collective trauma experienced over time by groups sharing an identity, impacting their health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATHANIEL VINCENT MOHATT<|>YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Nathaniel Vincent Mohatt conducts research on historical trauma at Yale University School of Medicine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZURE B THOMPSON<|>YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Azure B Thompson conducts research on historical trauma at Yale University School of Medicine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGHI D THAI<|>CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY<|>Nghi D Thai conducts research related to historical trauma at Central Connecticut State University<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes conducts research on historical trauma at Yale University School of Medicine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Research on historical trauma is conducted at Yale University School of Medicine<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY<|>Research on historical trauma is conducted at Central Connecticut State University<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
