Historical trauma is a promising but inadequately conceptualized area of research. A wide variety of research shows the short- and long-term health impact of trauma. Historical trauma functions a public narrative for particular groups or communities. We offer a model of historical trauma as present-day narrative that impacts health. Historical trauma narratives are a source of present-day distress and resilience.
