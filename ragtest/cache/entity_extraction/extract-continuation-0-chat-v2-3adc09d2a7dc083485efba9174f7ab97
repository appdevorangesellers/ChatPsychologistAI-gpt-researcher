Likewise, these children may have higher rates of school absenteeism and learning disorders due to DTD (184, 185). Children with DTD are affected across cognitive (e.g., learning, attention, and information processing), physiological (e.g., fight-or-flight, susceptibility to infections including from common colds and flu), emotional (e.g., depression and suicide, anger), and behavioral domains that span the continuum of internalizing and externalizing disturbances. Behavioral displays (or traumatic reenactments) that signal fear, emotional dysregulation, and vulnerability interfere with children's academic achievement, self-efficacy, and classroom behaviors. When individuals with DTD move into young adulthood, they may struggle to manage independently and experience difficulty adjusting to new settings. If they attend college or university, they may find it hard to self-regulate and map out the steps needed to complete assignments and tasks successfully. They may question the value of education, learning, or effort, given persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and existential despair. Some may drop out of school, experience inconsistent employment, or hold employment positions that are not satisfying (167, 186), likely because their vocational identity development was interrupted by chronic depression and anxiety (16, 187, 188) resulting from reoccurring abuse and neglect. Their lack of confidence and low self-esteem, along with high rates of addiction (189–191), can also lead to further increased anxiety, anger and hostility, and job instability (192, 193). They may feel worried about re-traumatization or being stigmatized because of their challenges. As a result, some will choose not to disclose personal information to others who might help them, believing that the vulnerability could put them at a disadvantage for recruitment or advancement. Clinicians and care supporters working with individuals who have experienced significant childhood trauma should be aware that DTD symptoms differ depending on the specific traumas experienced, the characteristics of the individuals involved, and the level of discordance between the individuals and their environments. Symptoms will also vary depending on each individual's degree of environmental support, perceived controllability of the stressful events, access to socioeconomic resources, and effective evaluations and treatments (194). Medical problems and somatic complaints may actually be the result of childhood trauma and a sign of DTD. In fact, a number of chronic, non-specific, or unexplained medical illnesses are associated with DTD (13, 56). In addition, lowered immunity, cardiac symptoms, and neurological disorders such as migraines and chronic fatigue are also signs to look for in patients who could potentially have DTD (195). Clinicians working with early trauma survivors should also consider relational patterns corresponding to substantive behavioral changes, particularly personality disturbances. Individuals exposed to severe abuse, neglect, and violence may go on to develop long-lasting negative schemas about themselves and the world, including deep feelings of inferiority, fear, self-hatred, and distrust, all of which can give rise to maladaptive personality styles and, in some cases, clinically significant characterological disturbances (196). As adults, individuals with DTD may develop a broad range of personality and emotional disorders (60, 68, 197), which are associated with high rates of emergency room visits and inpatient hospitalizations (17, 198).Treatment Empirically validated treatments for children and adolescents with DTD are limited in scope. However, there is growing evidence for integrative treatment approaches and relationally focused interventions as effective treatments for DTD [e.g., (4, 199)]. Two such approaches include the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency (ARC) model and dyadic-developmental psychotherapy, which include individual and family counseling sessions designed to enhance interpersonal communication, attachment security, and emotion regulation, and co-regulation between the parent and child; (200, 201). Concerning adolescents and adults with trauma, findings from recent systematic investigations and meta-analyses (202–204) suggest that a combination of psychotherapy (e.g., Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy) and antidepressant medication (205) are beneficial. However, more studies are needed as treatment effects were heterogeneous. Likewise, more studies are required to establish the long-term efficacy and risk-to-benefit tradeoff for the use of antipsychotic agents (risperidone, quetiapine), especially for children and adolescents, as well as anticonvulsant drugs (206), which are limited in use due to their side effects.Conclusions and future directions While developmental trauma is commonly linked to PTSD, the DTD diagnosis captures a more chronic and pervasive form of trauma represented by a constellation of complex and interacting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms beyond that of PTSD alone. Several studies suggest that children, adolescents, and adults with DTD display a broad range of mental health symptom profiles [e.g., (30, 31, 178, 207, 208)]. These individuals demonstrate significant problems in many areas of their lives, but without accurate assessment, advocacy, and treatment, they may live in mental anguish, vacillating between self-injury, suicidal and antisocial behaviors, and a significant inability to cope with reality and enhance their strengths and resiliencies. The DTD diagnosis offers clinicians the opportunity to more comprehensively account for the multitude of what might otherwise be viewed as divergent symptoms and discrete mental health disorders. The DTD diagnosis offers an all-encompassing conceptualization, within a single diagnostic, developmental syndrome, of the many different symptoms that may be experienced as a result of early trauma. The diagnosis may help limit the over-pathologizing of these individuals (i.e., they would receive a single diagnosis to capture their broad array of symptoms as opposed to three or more disparate diagnoses). More importantly, utilization of the DTD framework may\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Developmental trauma refers to the chronic and pervasive form of trauma experienced during childhood, which can lead to a constellation of complex cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DTD<|>EVENT<|>DTD is a diagnosis that captures the effects of developmental trauma, encompassing a range of mental health symptoms beyond PTSD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA-FOCUSED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>A type of psychotherapy that is beneficial for adolescents and adults with trauma, particularly in treating symptoms associated with DTD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTACHMENT, REGULATION, AND COMPETENCY (ARC) MODEL<|>EVENT<|>An integrative treatment approach designed to enhance interpersonal communication, attachment security, and emotion regulation for children with DTD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DYADIC-DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOTHERAPY<|>EVENT<|>A relationally focused intervention that includes individual and family counseling sessions aimed at improving emotional regulation and attachment security in children with DTD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION<|>EVENT<|>Medications that are beneficial for treating symptoms of trauma in adolescents and adults, particularly in conjunction with psychotherapy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS<|>EVENT<|>Medications such as risperidone and quetiapine that are used to treat trauma symptoms but have limited use due to side effects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Children who experience early interpersonal traumas and may develop symptoms associated with DTD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADOLESCENTS<|>PERSON<|>Young individuals who may struggle with the effects of developmental trauma and benefit from specific therapeutic interventions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals who have experienced developmental trauma in childhood and may exhibit a range of personality and emotional disorders.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>DTD<|>Developmental trauma is the underlying cause that leads to the diagnosis of DTD, capturing a range of symptoms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA-FOCUSED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY<|>DTD<|>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy is a recommended treatment for individuals diagnosed with DTD<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATTACHMENT, REGULATION, AND COMPETENCY (ARC) MODEL<|>DTD<|>The ARC model is an effective treatment approach for children suffering from DTD<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DYADIC-DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOTHERAPY<|>DTD<|>Dyadic-Developmental Psychotherapy is a treatment method aimed at addressing symptoms of DTD<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION<|>DTD<|>Antidepressant medication is beneficial for treating symptoms associated with DTD<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS<|>DTD<|>Antipsychotic agents are considered for treating symptoms of DTD, although their use is limited due to side effects<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Children are particularly vulnerable to developmental trauma, which can lead to various mental health issues<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADOLESCENTS<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Adolescents who have experienced developmental trauma may struggle with emotional regulation and self-management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADULTS<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Adults with a history of developmental trauma may develop long-lasting negative schemas and personality disturbances<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
