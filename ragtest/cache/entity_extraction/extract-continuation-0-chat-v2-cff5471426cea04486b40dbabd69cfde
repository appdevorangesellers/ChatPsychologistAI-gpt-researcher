The model also provides a basis for understanding individual and community level differences in health outcomes following trauma, since historical traumas are represented differently across individuals, families, populations, and contexts. A narrative approach addresses this concern by requiring careful consideration of individual and collective stories and their integration with contemporary cultural representations and contexts. Appadurai (2004) posits that culture, and by extension cultural identity, not only refers to past traditions and present norms, but also to a future-oriented capacity to aspire. Public narratives frame how we feel about the world and either inspire action or, as with hopelessness, inhibit it (Ganz, 2011). For cultural groups with significant shared histories of trauma and who experience present-day marginalization, such as many indigenous peoples across the world, a narrative of historical trauma may be a highly salient factor that sustains emotional and psychological wounds, thus functioning as a cultural narrative that inhibits psychological growth and collective aspiration (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009; Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013). In contrast, historical trauma narratives may also sustain resiliency in response to the ongoing oppression or wounding, as evidenced by family histories of survival (Denham, 2008). The model proposed here provides a means for examining systematically the conditions under which each of these health outcomes are likely to occur; that is, for identifying how historical trauma can have lasting and damaging impacts on health but also be the nexus of group- or community-wide transformation and resilience.Research highlights. Historical trauma is a promising but inadequately conceptualized area of research. A wide variety of research shows the short- and long-term health impact of trauma. Historical trauma functions a public narrative for particular groups or communities. We offer a model of historical trauma as present-day narrative that impacts health. Historical trauma narratives are a source of present-day distress and resilience.
