PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC4001826 NIHMSID: NIHMS569976 PMID: 24561774 The publisher's version of this article is available at Soc Sci Med Abstract Theories of historical trauma increasingly appear in the literature on individual and community health, especially in relation to racial and ethnic minority populations and groups that experience significant health disparities. As a consequence of this rapid growth, the literature on historical trauma comprises disparate terminology and research approaches. This critical review integrates this literature in order to specify theoretical mechanisms that explain how historical trauma influences the health of individuals and communities. We argue that historical trauma functions as a public narrative for particular groups or communities that connects present-day experiences and circumstances to the trauma so as to influence health. Treating historical trauma as a public narrative shifts the research discourse away from an exclusive search for past causal variables that influence health to identifying how present-day experiences, their corresponding narratives, and their health impacts are connected to public narratives of historical trauma for a particular group or community. We discuss how the connection between historical trauma and present-day experiences, related narratives, and health impacts may function as a source of present-day distress as well as resilience. Keywords: Historical trauma, personal narratives, public narratives, resilience, community healthIntroduction Historical trauma refers to a complex and collective trauma experienced over time and across generations by a group of people who share an identity, affiliation, or circumstance (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Crawford, 2013; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Gone, 2013). Although historical trauma was originally introduced to describe the experience of children of Holocaust survivors (Kellermann, 2001a), in the past two decades, the term has been applied to numerous colonized indigenous groups throughout the world, as well as African Americans, Armenian refugees, Japanese American survivors of internment camps, Swedish immigrant children whose parents were torture victims, Palestinian youth, the people of Cyprus, Belgians, Cambodians, Israelis, Mexicans and Mexican Americans, Russians, and many other cultural groups and communities that share a history of oppression, victimization, or massive group trauma exposure (Baker & Gippenreiter, 1998; Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011; Daud, Skoglund, & Rydelius, 2005; Karenian et al., 2011; Sotero, 2006; Wexler, DiFluvio, & Burke, 2009). Scholars from various disciplines have described the generational aspect of historical trauma as transgenerational, intergenerational, multi-generational, or cross-generational (Bar-On et al., 1998; Kellermann, 2001b), and have introduced concepts, such as soul wound (Duran, 2006; Duran & Duran, 1995) or Post Traumatic Slavery Syndrome (Leary, 2005), to capture the collective experience of trauma by specific cultural groups across generations. Despite the multitude of terms, historical trauma can be understood as consisting of three primary elements: a “trauma” or wounding; the trauma is shared by a group of people, rather than an individually experienced; the trauma spans multiple generations, such that contemporary members of the affected group may experience trauma-related symptoms without having been present for the past traumatizing event(s). It is distinct from intergenerational trauma in that intergenerational trauma refers to the specific experience of trauma across familial generations, but does not necessarily imply a shared group trauma. Similarly, a collective trauma may not have the generational or historical aspect, though over time may develop into historical trauma. The widespread interest in historical trauma by scholars across many disciplines presents two unique challenges for this new and rapidly growing area: 1) how to make sense of a diverse empirical literature, and 2) how to integrate that literature with theory so as to advance scientific inquiry. In this critical review and integration, we address these challenges by providing a conceptual framework for understanding the empirical literature on historical trauma, and then specify a theoretical model based on that framework that explains how historical trauma affects present-day health among individuals and communities.Trauma as Narrative Representation Central to our perspective is the view that historical trauma functions as a contemporary narrative with personal and public representations in the present. In an influential article published in this journal, Stjepan Meštrović (1985) discussed how early scholarly work on stress and trauma emphasized that trauma is a psychological process independent from the specific traumatic event, that is, as “representation.” He argued that scientific\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The School of Medicine is an academic institution located at 389 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, CT, focusing on medical education and research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE B THOMPSON<|>PERSON<|>Azure B Thompson is an author affiliated with the School of Medicine, contributing to research in the field of medicine.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NGHI D THAI<|>PERSON<|>Nghi D Thai is an author associated with the Department of Psychological Science at Central Connecticut State University, contributing to psychological research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>PERSON<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes is an author affiliated with the Division of Prevention & Community Research at Yale University School of Medicine, focusing on community health research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Central Connecticut State University is an educational institution located at 1615 Stanley Street, New Britain, CT, offering various academic programs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yale University is a prestigious Ivy League university located in New Haven, CT, known for its research and academic excellence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the collective trauma experienced over generations by specific cultural groups due to oppression and victimization.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZURE B THOMPSON<|>SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Azure B Thompson is an author contributing to research at the School of Medicine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGHI D THAI<|>CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY<|>Nghi D Thai is an author affiliated with the Department of Psychological Science at Central Connecticut State University<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes is an author contributing to research at the School of Medicine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes is affiliated with the Division of Prevention & Community Research at Yale University<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NGHI D THAI<|>SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>Nghi D Thai is indirectly related through academic research in psychology and health<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCHOOL OF MEDICINE<|>YALE UNIVERSITY<|>Both institutions are involved in medical and psychological research and education<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes's research may address the impacts of historical trauma on community health<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
