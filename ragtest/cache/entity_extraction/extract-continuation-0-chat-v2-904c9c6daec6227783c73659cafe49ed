In an influential article published in this journal, Stjepan Meštrović (1985) discussed how early scholarly work on stress and trauma emphasized that trauma is a psychological process independent from the specific traumatic event, that is, as “representation.” He argued that scientific methods should be employed to understand how representations of traumatic experiences impact health (Meštrović, 1985). Subsequent work by medical anthropologist Allan Young further demonstrated how psychological trauma relies on two levels of narrative: 1) an internal logic describing a cause-effect relationship between a past event and present symptoms, and 2) memory as a constructed representation of a traumatic event (Young, 1997, 2004). Young (1997) also showed that trauma varied so dramatically across historical periods and cultures that we cannot assume that past generations represented their traumatic experiences in the same way we would today. Further, because trauma is a representation as opposed to an event, and because we cannot directly know the minds and lives of the past, we cannot assume that our way of responding to negative events is valid for prior generations. Viewing trauma as narrative—representations that contain both personal and public components—directs our focus to the development and impact of present-day representations and their connection to the historic past. To the extent that historical trauma is a narrative representation, it connects histories of group-experienced traumatic events to present day experiences and contexts, including the contemporary health of a group or community. Thus, historical trauma operates through a layering of narrative turns, including trauma as a concept represented in stories, history as socially endorsed memory, and an internal logic linking history to present suffering or resilience (Crawford, 2013). A narrative framework for historical trauma offers improved conceptual clarity and opportunity for scientific investigation into the relationship between trauma and present-day health by considering the ways in which historical traumas are represented in contemporary individual and community stories. Further, conceptualizing historical trauma as a public narrative avoids problems with projecting contemporary theory back in time, while calling on scholars to engage the full, culture-laden complexity of public narratives in scientific inquiry. In subsequent sections, we review the existing research on historical trauma across cultures, elaborate on historical trauma as public narrative, and describe the links between psychological health and personal and public narratives. Finally, we present a simplified theoretical model that specifies how historical trauma as a public narrative influences individual and community health.Existing Research and Theory on Historical Trauma A number of empirical studies have shown that groups who have histories of trauma are more vulnerable to diminished psychological health in later generations. Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews show that children of Holocaust survivors from Israel to Canada are more vulnerable to PTSD, and Barel, Van IJzendoorn, Sagi-Schwartz, and Bakermans-Kranenburg’s (2010) meta-analysis shows that second and third generation offspring of Holocaust survivors display both remarkable resilience and heightened post-traumatic stress symptoms. Daoud, Shankardass, O’Campo, Anderson, and Agbaria (2012) documented lower self-rated health, poorer socio-economic status, and higher stress among Palestinians displaced during the Nakba of 1948 and their descendants in comparison to families who were not displaced. Karenian et al. (2011) found elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms among descendants of the Armenian genocide that, while persistent, seem to be fading with every subsequent generation. Several studies of Canadian First Nations indigenous peoples have found that a family history of forced boarding school attendance and removal from one’s family and community is associated with a number of subsequent behavioral health challenges in later generations, including: increased exposure to sexual violence and involvement in child welfare systems (Pearce et al., 2008), injection drug use (Lemstra, Rogers, Thompson, Moraros, & Buckingham, 2012), current depressive symptoms and increased exposure to trauma (Bombay, Matheson, & Anisman, 2011), and a history of abuse associated with suicidal thoughts and attempts (Elias et al., 2012). Among a sample of North American Plains Indians, Whitbeck, Adams, et al. (2004) have shown that historical trauma affects psychological health through the experience of loss. Their research has demonstrated that, among Native Americans, the frequency of thinking about losses associated with historical traumas: is associated with distressed feelings (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004); mediates the effect of perceived discrimination on alcohol abuse (Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, & Adams, 2004); is distinct from depression (Whitbeck, Walls, Johnson, Morrisseau, & McDougall, 2009); and is a significant source of distress over and above other proximate stressors, such as childhood adversity and negative life events (Walls & Whitbeck, 2011). The empirical research on historical trauma has followed the growth of theory that links historical trauma to individual and community health. Bar-on et al. (1998) apply attachment theory to explain the preponderance of insecure-ambivalent attachment observed among children of Holocaust survivors, an observation supported in Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews of research with this population that showed a predisposition to anxiety-related disorders in later generations. Brave Heart and DeBruyn (1998) point out that government policies toward the Lakota people disrupted culture-based grieving processes, thus resulting in mass unresolved grief. A number of scholars further argue that the violent colonization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas disrupted culture-based protective factors, community systems, and parenting knowledge, thus leading to increased psychosocial risk, inadequate parenting,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>STJEPAN MEŠTROVIĆ<|>PERSON<|>Stjepan Meštrović is a scholar who published an influential article discussing the psychological process of trauma and its representation in health contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLAN YOUNG<|>PERSON<|>Allan Young is a medical anthropologist who demonstrated how psychological trauma relies on narrative representations of traumatic events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KELLERMANN<|>PERSON<|>Kellermann conducted reviews showing that children of Holocaust survivors are more vulnerable to PTSD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAOUD<|>PERSON<|>Daoud is a researcher who documented health impacts among Palestinians displaced during the Nakba of 1948.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KARENIAN<|>PERSON<|>Karenian found elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms among descendants of the Armenian genocide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITBECK<|>PERSON<|>Whitbeck is a researcher who studied the effects of historical trauma on psychological health among North American Plains Indians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKOTA PEOPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Lakota people are an indigenous group whose culture-based grieving processes were disrupted by government policies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICAN PLAINS INDIANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>North American Plains Indians are a group studied for the psychological effects of historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLOCAUST<|>EVENT<|>The Holocaust was a historical event that caused significant trauma, affecting the psychological health of survivors and their descendants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAKBA OF 1948<|>EVENT<|>The Nakba of 1948 refers to the displacement of Palestinians, which has lasting health impacts on their descendants.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STJEPAN MEŠTROVIĆ<|>ALLAN YOUNG<|>Both scholars contributed to the understanding of trauma as a psychological process and its representation in health contexts.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KELLERMANN<|>HOLOCAUST<|>Kellermann's research on PTSD vulnerability is directly related to the experiences of Holocaust survivors.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAOUD<|>NAKBA OF 1948<|>Daoud's research on health impacts is linked to the historical event of the Nakba of 1948.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KARENIAN<|>HOLOCAUST<|>Karenian's findings on post-traumatic stress symptoms are connected to the historical trauma of the Holocaust.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITBECK<|>NORTH AMERICAN PLAINS INDIANS<|>Whitbeck's research on historical trauma affects the psychological health of North American Plains Indians.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAKOTA PEOPLE<|>WHITBECK<|>Whitbeck's studies include the Lakota people and their experiences with historical trauma.<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
