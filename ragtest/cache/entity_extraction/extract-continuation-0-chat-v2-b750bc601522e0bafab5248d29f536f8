As the evidence presented in this chapter indicates, key interventions that have the potential to reduce mental and developmental disorders in childhood are parenting skills training that includes psychosocial stimulation, teacher training with “The Incredible Years” program, and maternal mental health interventions. The evidence suggests that these can be feasibly delivered in LMICs, and that they have a strong efficacy in HICs. CBT for anxiety disorders has a strong evidence base in HICs, but much more work is needed to demonstrate the feasible delivery of this intervention in LMICs. Pharmacotherapy requires specialist care and assessment that limits use in LMICs.The screening of children for developmental disorders is possible in LMICs; however, the evidence for intervening once autism or intellectual disability has been identified is limited. Similarly, child protection and reduction of bullying in schools are important preventive strategies for childhood mental disorders. The systems required for child protection are complex and require collaboration across sectors and significant government investment. Further research on interventions to protect children is urgently required in LMICs. Reducing bullying in schools may prevent mental disorders in childhood and later in life; however, there are no data to show effective programs in LMICs.The widespread implementation and evaluation of parenting skills training, including psychosocial stimulation and maternal mental health interventions, is recommended in all countries to achieve a meaningful reduction in the global prevalence and burden of childhood mental and developmental disorders.ReferencesAPA (American Psychiatric Association). 2013.
