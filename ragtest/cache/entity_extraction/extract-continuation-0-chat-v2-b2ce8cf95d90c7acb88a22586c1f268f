Regardless of whether the past traumas are felt based on place, ethnicity, or other social, cultural, or contextual groupings, the public narratives created in response to trauma influence one’s sense of identity.Conclusion History provides a narrative context within which contemporary social issues are interpreted. By incorporating a rich understanding of community or group history into social science research on health, we improve the local relevance and responsiveness of research findings and enhance the ability of interventions to leverage community-level and culturally-relevant strategies and variables (Trickett et al., 2011). Should the history contain trauma, the questions become in what ways the historical traumas may or may not be present or impactful and how we might as people and communities respond to these histories in order to promote resilience. Present-day political forces are increasingly calling for dominant cultures to apologize for historical traumas and document the “truth” of the traumas. In theory, truth commissions promise to repair damage of past abuses through rhetorical strategies that change the dominant cultural narrative to an admission of guilt and wrong doing (Edwards, 2010). Yet, research on the impact of truth commissions is mixed. Evidence from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission suggests that the commission improved general knowledge but had little to no impact on participant well-being (Kaminer, Stein, Mbanga, & Zungu-Dirwayi, 2001; Stein et al., 2008). Miller (2006) argues that for Canadian First Nations the social-political forms of these apologies may be incongruous with First Nations cultural practices and expectations of reconciliation, thereby limiting their benefit for the aggrieved cultures while benefiting (yet again) the dominant culture. The politics of apology and recognition are thorny—the “political economy of trauma” may do more to benefit the dominant cultures who are apologizing, maintaining their dominance and power, or may help usher in a new period of greater equality (James, 2004). We argue that studying narratives of historical trauma can help disentangle the ways in which contemporary actions perpetrate or repair historical wounds. Our critical review of historical trauma as a public narrative offers a framework for analyzing how historical traumas are relayed and connected to present-day contexts and health outcomes. Public narratives of historical trauma interact with contemporary reminders of these stories. The reminders serve to make the public narrative more or less salient to particular individuals, families, groups, and communities. The degree of narrative salience, in turn, influences the interpretation of an historical trauma response that manifests as a health impact. Importantly, we suggest that these linkages are recursive, that is, they operate in both directions such that the historical trauma narratives and health impacts mutually influence one another. At the heart of our review is the conviction that research into historical trauma should remain trained on present-day factors. We believe there are two critical reasons for this. First, we cannot go back in time to document what precisely happened in the past; our knowledge of the past is contained in narrative. And second, as Young (1997) shows, trauma is a present day construct based on contemporary modes of representation and interpretation. Therefore, since we cannot assume that our notions of trauma can be validly projected back through time, our efforts should focus on how the panoply of social science research methods can seek to understand and explain how present day historical trauma narratives impact health. We view our proposed narrative model as a heuristic for conducting such research, and believe it is relevant to the many social science disciplines currently engaged in studying historical trauma. We also believe that narrative methods are essential to documenting the processes that link public narratives of historical trauma to health outcomes, including experiences of contemporary reminders and the salience given to specific narratives. However, we also believe that a range of mixed methods (Tebes, 2012) are essential to confirm, elucidate, or alter stages described in the model. Research with specific cultural groups is also critical to indentify locally relevant reminders that serve as mediators and moderators of health outcomes, such a sense of historical loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). It is also critical to consider historical trauma as a potential source of both distress and resilience. Research should seek to disentangle how, for whom, when, and where positive sequelae can develop following mass trauma exposure. By studying contemporary experiences of mass trauma and the public narratives that communities generate following trauma, we can better understand how to address historical trauma narratives to enhance community health. In particular, consideration of historical trauma narratives requires attention to the social ecology of history, trauma, and identity for a given population. Historical trauma narratives most likely vary in individual, family, community, and dominant cultural narratives. Disentangling how these differences influence individual and community health is crucial to identifying intervention strategies to promote resilience within the context of historical trauma. Finally, we believe the narrative model of historical trauma proposed addresses a number of weaknesses of existing historical trauma theories. Green and Darity (2010) warn that current theories of historical trauma fail to account for the effects of daily indignities and make problematic assumptions about marginalized populations. Our proposed model effectively addresses these issues through its emphasis on contemporary reminders and its focus on personal and public salience. The model also provides a basis for understanding individual and community level differences in health outcomes following trauma, since historical traumas are represented differently across individuals, families, populations, and contexts. A narrative approach addresses this concern by requiring careful consideration of individual and collective stories and their integration with contemporary cultural representations and contexts. Appadurai (2004) posits that culture, and by extension cultural identity, not only refers to past traditions and present norms, but also to a\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA<|>GEO<|>Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country where mass trauma experiences have been studied in relation to people's relationships to place.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is an organization that aims to address historical traumas through public narratives and apologies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to improve general knowledge about past abuses but had limited impact on participant well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADIAN FIRST NATIONS<|>GEO<|>Canadian First Nations are indigenous groups that may find the social-political forms of apologies incongruous with their cultural practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological wounds experienced by a group due to past atrocities and injustices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMUNITY HEALTH<|>EVENT<|>Community health refers to the health outcomes and well-being of a specific population, influenced by historical trauma narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASS TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Mass trauma refers to widespread psychological harm experienced by a community or population due to significant adverse events.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The narrative model proposed in the text serves as a framework for understanding the impact of historical trauma on health outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Research in social sciences aims to understand the effects of historical trauma and its narratives on health and community resilience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Research in Bosnia-Herzegovina focuses on the impact of mass trauma experiences on relationships to place and identity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission aims to address historical trauma through public narratives and apologies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to address historical trauma but had mixed results<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CANADIAN FIRST NATIONS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Canadian First Nations experience historical trauma and may find apologies incongruous with their cultural practices<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>COMMUNITY HEALTH<|>Historical trauma narratives can significantly influence community health outcomes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASS TRAUMA<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Mass trauma is a form of historical trauma that affects communities and their health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>RESEARCH<|>The narrative model is proposed as a framework for conducting research on historical trauma and its health impacts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>CANADIAN FIRST NATIONS<|>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's apologies may not align with the cultural practices of Canadian First Nations<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
