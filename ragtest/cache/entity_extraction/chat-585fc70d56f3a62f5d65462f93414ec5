A National Library of Medicine study using fMRI revealed that different types of trauma (e.g., abuse vs. neglect) uniquely impact areas of the brain responsible for cognitive regulation, emotional processing, and executive functioning. When such trauma occurs during critical periods of brain development, some of these changes may become hardwired into the brain's structure.\nThe brain's development is one of the most significantly affected areas when it comes to childhood trauma.
