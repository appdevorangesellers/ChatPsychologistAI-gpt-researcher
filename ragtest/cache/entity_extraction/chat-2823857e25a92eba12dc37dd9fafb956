Positively\nperceived experiences from community engagement or\nservice-learning have been linked to reduced mental health\nissues such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety\n(Ottenritter, 2004). These positive experiences are included\nin the psychological and social dimensions of the Keyes\ncontinuum (Keyes, 2007; Low, 2011).\nThis\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n5\n0\narticle adds to the literature by examining whether\ndebt burdens and perceived financial capabilities of young\nadults are associated with young adults’ flourishing and\nlanguishing mental health outcomes after controlling for\nhealth, other sociodemographic factors, parental influence,\nand social engagement levels.\nMethods\nI\nD\n:\nt\ni\n0\n0\n5\n5\nData\nThis\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n5\n5\nstudy uses data from the PSID and its Transition to\nAdulthood (TA) supplement to examine the associations\namong debt burdens, perceived financial capability, and\nthe physical and psychological well-being of young adults.\nThe PSID is a longitudinal study of a nationally represen-\ntative sample of U.S. men, women, and children, as well\nas their families. For approximately the past four decades,\nthe study has collected annual data from these families and\nindividuals with regard to their demographic, economic,\nPdf_Folio:189\nJournal of Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 32, Number 2, 2021\n189\n\nand employment behavior. The TA supplement includes\ndata on young adults aged 17–29. For the empirical anal-\nysis of this study, data on parental influence, student loan\ndebt, social participation, psychological and cognitive well-\nbeing, development, and perceived ability were drawn from\nthe TA supplement. Respondents under 18 years of age were\nexcluded from the analysis. This study uses a panel con-\nstructed from the 2009 to 2013 waves of the PSID and its\nTA supplement.\nVariables\nDependent Variables. The\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n6\n0\ndependent variables for this\nstudy were constructed based on a composite mental health\ncontinuum scale that measured the emotional, social, and\npsychological well-being of the respondents, which is\nincluded in the PSID-TA dataset. The scale was originally\nincluded in the Midlife in the United States study (MIDUS)\nand has since been available in the PSID-TA supplement for\nthe 2009–2013 waves. The scale itself comprises three dif-\nferent sub-scales: the MIDUS scale of emotional well-being\n(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87) (Kessler et al., 1998); Ryff’s scale\nof psychological well-being (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.79) (Ryff\n& Keyes, 1995); and Keyes’s scale of social well-being\n(Cronbach’s alpha = .80) (Keyes, 1998). The emotional\nwell-being sub-component developed originally by Kessler\net al. (1998) comprised of three items related to emotional\nwell-being—happiness, interest in life, and feeling satisfied.\nAll three items were coded as 1 = lowest and 6 = high-\nest. The psychological well-being sub-component was orig-\ninally developed by Ryff and Keyes (1995) and included\nthe following six items—feeling good about managing daily\nresponsibility, perception of having trusting relationships,\nfeeling challenged to grow, feeling confident of own ideas,\nliking one’s own personality, and feeling of having direction\nin life. All six items were coded as 1 = lowest and 6 = high-\nest. The social well-being sub-component was developed by\nKeyes (1998) and comprised of the following five items:\nfeeling of having something to contribute to in society, feel-\ning of belonging to the community, feeling of society get-\nting better, feeling that people are generally good, feeling\nthe way that society works makes sense. All six items were\ncoded as 1 = lowest and 6 = highest. The scores from these\nsub-components were then scaled to the participants’ scores\non the composite flourishing-languishing continuum scale\nand ranged from 1 = least flourishing to 18 = most flourish-\ning. This composite scale is computed and made available in\nthe PSID-TA dataset. Respondents with higher scores on the\ncomposite scale (range: 1–18) are considered to be flourish-\ning mentally, while respondents with lower scores are con-\nsidered to be languishing mentally. The Cronbach’s alpha\nfor the scale in our study was .77.\nKeyes\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n6\n5\n(2002) sorted the respondents into three groups based\non their scores on the Keyes mental health continuum scale.\nFrom this scale, Keyes constructed separate binary variables\nfor flourishing and languishing based on the respondents’\nscores on the scale. The respondents in the top tertile of\nscores in the scale were coded as flourishing, those in the\nbottom tertile of the scale were coded as languishing, and\nthose who were in the middle tertile were coded as moder-\nate. Similarly, we follow this methodology in our study to\nconstruct a categorical variable where 3 = flourishing (score\nin the top tertile of the Keyes scale); 2 = moderate or sta-\nble (score in the middle tertile of the Keyes scale); 1 = lan-\nguishing (score in the bottom tertile of the Key\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
