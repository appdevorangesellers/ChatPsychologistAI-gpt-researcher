Individuals with this disorder may have strong reactions to small setbacks, feel their emotions more intensely than others, have difficulty calming down, and have a low tolerance for frustration or annoyance. The cycle of distress Wanting to minimize or avoid strong and negative emotions is part of what is often called a ‘cycle of shame.’ This pattern often looks like the Experimental Avoidance Model by Chapman, Gratz, & Brown (2006). This model explains that self-harm is primarily maintained by negative reinforcement in the form of escape or avoidance of unwanted emotional experiences. This effectively levels out the rollercoaster of emotions until the next time. This can be applied to any unhelpful coping strategy that people use instead of regulating their emotions. When people use these unhelpful strategies, they do not feel good about using them despite their short-term effectiveness. These tend to add to a larger sense of shame or failure that sets the stage for the whole process to begin again. This is how it can become a vicious cycle. Breaking the distress cycle Changing any part of the cycle can interfere with the pattern and lead to more positive thoughts and feelings. Techniques such as those employed in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you learn how to understand and work with the relationship between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Learn to pay attention to the way the thought-emotion-behavior relationship works for you, then ask yourself some questions: What particular ideas or thought patterns are causing a reaction in your mind? Which emotions do you find most difficult to endure or handle? What methods or actions do you take to ease your anxiety? To what extent do these techniques provide relief in both immediate and long-term situations? Are there any fundamental convictions you hold about yourself, others, or the world that have a bearing on the negative spiral? Alternatively, what are the thoughts and convictions that contribute the most to generating positive emotions for you? It is important to note that there can be a variety of strategies that are used to deal with emotions, even overwhelming ones. What happens most often is that these strategies are not applied flexibly, and someone may use the same unhelpful strategy in every negative situation. Putting effort into questioning what thoughts you have and what coping strategies you gravitate towards is an essential step toward ending the distress cycle. Skills for regulating emotions Learning emotion regulation skills will help us learn to effectively manage and change the way we feel and cope with situations. 1. Name the emotion Attempting to avoid unpleasant thoughts and feelings can actually result in more unwanted negative thoughts and feelings. Rather than avoiding unpleasant emotions, acknowledge their presence and name them specifically. It can be helpful to say out loud or think to yourself, ‘I am feeling sad/angry/afraid. If you are uncertain about what emotion you are feeling, you can use a ‘Feelings Wheel,’ which displays many of the primary and secondary emotions one may feel. Naming the emotion often leads to the emotion losing its power. It can allow us to let go of some of the pain and discomfort that accompany the unpleasant emotion. 2. Recognize and understand the emotion It makes sense to believe that people who are unclear about their emotions are also less aware and less clear about their psychological needs. A way in which you can become more aware of what you are feeling is to pay attention to what you are experiencing physiologically in your body. For instance, you may have an unsettled feeling in your stomach when feeling anxious, or you may feel a tightness in your chest if you are feeling sad. 3. Validate the emotion It is key to recognize that your emotions are present for a valid reason and that they are telling you something. Practice self-compassion and give yourself support for the unpleasant emotions you are experiencing. Understand that feeling strong negative emotions are a normal part of life. Try to breathe into the experience of your emotions. You can soothe hurt feelings by placing a hand over your body where you feel this experience, then breathe slowly into this area. Inquire within as to whether there may be something you can do to address this feeling without any expectation that something needs to be done. 4. Identify and resolve emotional triggers Often, we may have an interpretation of a situation that can trigger a strong emotional reaction. To help with regulating our emotions, it is key to learn to recognize emotional triggers. By identifying triggers, you can address the underlying issue and change your emotional response. Remember that you always have a choice on how to respond and what to do with the information you have. 5. Use chair work dialogues Another technique that can aid emotion regulation is chair work dialogues (Greenberg, 2021). This involves imagining a conversation between different parts of yourself. For example, you can externalize an internal critical voice by giving it a chair. Notice when this part attacks vulnerable emotions, making you feel flawed. Dialogue with the critic, expressing the pain it causes. Work to uncover the unmet needs or shame driving its harshness. Chair work also allows compassionately soothing distressed parts of yourself. Comfort a scared inner child and provide the safety it lacked. Or encourage an angry part to express its frustration adaptively. By making inner dynamics explicit through role play, you gain awareness of what triggers painful states. The parts can then integrate, resolving inner conflicts that dysregulate emotions. 6. Use imagery to transform emotions Imagery is another effective strategy for modulating emotions (Greenberg, 2021). Visualization accesses right-brain processes, evoking feelings rapidly. Imagine revisiting a scene where you felt overwhelmed, like childhood mistreatment or rejection. See yourself as a vulnerable child in this situation. What emotions arise? Fear, loneliness, shame? Stay with these painful feelings briefly. Now visualize your current self entering the scene, ready to intervene. Offer the child protection and meet their unmet needs. Provide the safety and comfort they lacked. Dialogue with the child to understand their distress\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
