The dispensing of stimulant medications is increasing in HICs (Hollingworth and others 2011; McCarthy and others 2012), but no studies have examined whether these trends exist in LMICs. The wide recognition in HICs of the problems of stimulant medication diversion and misuse has resulted in recommendations for increased monitoring and regulations (Kaye and Darke 2012). Therefore, although stimulant medications are very effective treatments for ADHD, the potential difficulties with obtaining comprehensive assessments of the children to ensure accurate diagnosis and the high likelihood of diversion and misuse in the absence of regulatory systems limit the feasibility of the widespread use of stimulant medications in LMICs.Specialist Health CareMedications for Conduct DisorderParenting interventions are the best treatments for younger children with disruptive behavioral disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. However, the use of pharmacotherapy can assist in the treatment of adolescents with conduct disorder. Recent evidence has suggested that the use of pharmacologic agents—in particular, second-generation antipsychotics—is increasing (Pringsheim and Gorman 2012) in children and adolescents with conduct disorder.Although the use of such agents is increasing, the evidence base is not necessarily strong. Reasonably strong evidence supports the use, particularly in the short term, of second-generation antipsychotics, especially risperidone, in young people with borderline intelligence quotients (IQs) (Duhig, Saha, and Scott 2013). However, the evidence in young people with a normal IQ is not strong. Other agents have also been evaluated in such children, including stimulants and lithium (Ipser and Stein 2007). Psychopharmacological therapy in young people with conduct disorder needs to be carefully monitored and only introduced within the setting of specialist care (Ipser and Stein 2007). Its routine use, particularly in LMICs, is not recommended.Psychosocial Treatments for Conduct DisorderPsychosocial treatments have been evaluated for children and adolescents with conduct disorder and other disruptive behaviors, including cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI), problem-solving skills therapy (PSST), and multisystem therapy.Cognitive behavioral intervention. The goal of CBI is to train children in altering their dysfunctional (aggressive) cognitive processes. Generally, such interventions have been found to be effective in children with disruptive behaviors, with effect sizes observed of approximately 0.67 (Sukhodolsky, Kassinove, and Gorman 2004). A meta-analysis of CBI and parenting interventions and CBI for the treatment of youth with antisocial behavior problems (a common sequalae of conduct disorder) found that the effect size was 0.47 for parenting interventions and 0.35 for CBI (McCart and others 2006). This review concluded that parent training appeared to have greater impacts on younger children and CBI was more effective for adolescents.Problem-solving skills therapy. PSST is an individual-based intervention for children and adolescents that focuses on changing the way children interact with the significant others in their lives. The existing evaluations of this type of therapy were conducted in the 1990s (Kazdin, Siegel, and Bass 1992). These studies have shown the therapy to be largely efficacious and incrementally supportive of the therapeutic effects of parent training (Handwerk and others 2012). PSST has also been found to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for conduct disorder. The evidence suggests that PSST can complement parenting interventions and increase the effectiveness of parenting interventions incrementally (Handwerk and others 2012). The evidence for adapting PSST to various cultures is limited, and further research is required before this intervention can be recommended in LMICs.Multisystem therapy. Multisystem therapy is a comprehensive intervention targeting adolescents with disruptive behaviors. It is a highly intensive therapy based on the use of different types of therapies deemed appropriate by individual therapists. The existing evaluations of this therapy, including meta-analyses, have demonstrated its efficacy, particularly in adolescents with more serious delinquency tendencies (Curtis, Ronan, and Borduin 2004). However, the therapy’s highly intensive nature may render it unsuitable as an intervention in LMICs.Handwerk and others (2012) provide an excellent summary of the literature on interventions targeting conduct disorders. The overall recommendations include parent training, particularly for parents of younger children, with the choice of intervention format largely a matter of personal and health system preference. The evidence base for CBI is not as extensive as that for parenting interventions; the effect sizes appear to be small to modest. Notably, the augmentation of parenting interventions with CBI appears to be particularly promising. Furthermore, CBI interventions seem to have more efficacy in adolescents.Cost-Effectiveness AnalysesThe evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of interventions targeting children and adolescents is considerably more modest than that for adults. In a systematic review of the literature that included studies published up to 2009, Kilian and others (2010) found 19 studies of the cost-effectiveness of psychiatric interventions targeting children and adolescents. Few studies use a cost-utility analysis framework, whereby outcomes are expressed as generic indices combining mortality and morbidity; a common example of such an outcome is quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The advantage of cost-utility analysis is that value-for-money judgments can be made, since thresholds of good value can be specified for QALYs in different health care settings (Drummond and others 2005). Moreover, interventions can be compared within and across different disorder categories.Studies of pharmacological interventions for ADHD have largely found such interventions to be cost-effective (King and others 2006), with existing studies finding that\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ADHD<|>EVENT<|>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness, often treated with stimulant medications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HICs<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High-Income Countries where stimulant medications for ADHD are widely recognized and prescribed.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LMICs<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Low- and Middle-Income Countries where the use of stimulant medications for ADHD is limited due to regulatory issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KAYE AND DARKE<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who have made recommendations regarding the monitoring and regulation of stimulant medication use in HICs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINGSHEIM AND GORMAN<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who have studied the increasing use of pharmacologic agents for conduct disorder in children and adolescents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUHIG, SAHA, AND SCOTT<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who provided evidence supporting the use of second-generation antipsychotics in young people with borderline IQs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IPSER AND STEIN<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who have evaluated the use of psychopharmacological therapy in young people with conduct disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (CBI)<|>EVENT<|>A therapeutic approach aimed at altering dysfunctional cognitive processes in children with disruptive behaviors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Problem-Solving Skills Therapy (PSST)<|>EVENT<|>An individual-based intervention focusing on improving children's interactions with significant others.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Multisystem Therapy<|>EVENT<|>A comprehensive intervention targeting adolescents with disruptive behaviors, utilizing various therapeutic approaches.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HICs<|>LMICs<|>HICs have established practices for ADHD treatment that are not yet implemented in LMICs due to regulatory challenges<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KAYE AND DARKE<|>HICs<|>Kaye and Darke's recommendations for monitoring stimulant medication use are relevant to practices in HICs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINGSHEIM AND GORMAN<|>EVENT<|>Pringsheim and Gorman's research on pharmacologic agents is related to the treatment of conduct disorder<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUHIG, SAHA, AND SCOTT<|>EVENT<|>Their findings on second-generation antipsychotics are relevant to the treatment of young people with conduct disorder<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IPSER AND STEIN<|>EVENT<|>Ipser and Stein's evaluations of psychopharmacological therapy are pertinent to the treatment of conduct disorder<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (CBI)<|>EVENT<|>CBI is a recommended treatment for children with disruptive behaviors, showing effectiveness in various studies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Problem-Solving Skills Therapy (PSST)<|>EVENT<|>PSST is an intervention that complements parenting interventions for children with conduct disorder<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Multisystem Therapy<|>EVENT<|>Multisystem therapy is an intensive approach for treating adolescents with serious behavioral issues<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
