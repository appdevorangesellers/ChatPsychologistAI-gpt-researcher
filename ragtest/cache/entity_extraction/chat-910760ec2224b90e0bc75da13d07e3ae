Two contributing factors are the increases in the proportion of children and adolescents in the populations of LMICs, which is a result of reduced mortality of children under age five years (Murray and others 2012), and the fact that the onset of many adult mental and developmental disorders occurs in childhood and adolescence (Kessler and others 2007).Global Epidemiology and the Burden of Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersAscertaining the global epidemiology of mental disorders is a difficult task, given the significant paucity of data for many geographical regions, as well as the cultural variations in presentation and measurement. These issues are exacerbated when investigating mental disorders in children, particularly in LMICs where other health concerns, such as infectious diseases, are priorities. The issue of data paucity was highlighted in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) (Whiteford and others 2013).Epidemiologically, childhood mental disorders were relatively consistent across the 21 world regions defined by GBD 2010. However, these prevalence estimates were based on sparse data; some regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, have no data whatsoever for some disorders or no data for specific disorders in childhood. Although regional differences may exist, the lack of data makes them difficult to ascertain. The 12-month global prevalence of childhood mental disorders in 2010 is shown in table 8.1. ADHD, conduct disorder, and autism were more prevalent in males; females were more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders and ADHD were more common in adolescents compared with children.Table 8.1Global Point Prevalence of Childhood Mental and Developmental Disorders by Gender and Total Number of Cases, 2010. Most children and adolescents with mental and developmental disorders were in South Asia, reflecting the high population in this region and the reduction in mortality of infants and young children (Murray and others 2012). The populations of LMICs tend to have higher proportions of children and adolescents than those of high-income countries (HICs). For example, 40 percent of the population in the least developed countries is younger than age 15 years, compared with 17 percent in more developed regions (United Nations 2011). Furthermore, population aging is occurring more slowly in LMICs, with some low-income countries predicted to have the youngest populations by 2050, given their high fertility rates (United Nations 2011). These trends mean that childhood mental and developmental disorders will increase in significance in LMICs. Furthermore, the continuing reductions in infant mortality caused by infectious diseases mean more children will reach adolescence where the prevalence of mental disorders increases and the onset of adult mental disorders occurs. This will challenge already limited mental health services in these countries.Risk Factors for Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersThe risk factors for childhood mental and developmental disorders shown in table 8.2 can be divided into lifelong and age-specific risk factors (Kieling and others 2011). The health of children is highly dependent on the health and well-being of their caregivers; the environments in which the children live (including home and school); and, as they transition into adolescence, the influence of their peers. The relative importance of a particular risk factor should be considered in terms of prevalence, strength of the association with an adverse outcome, and potential to reduce exposure to that risk factor (Scott and others 2014). Using these criteria, efforts to address maternal mental health problems and improve parenting skills have the greatest potential to reduce mental and developmental disorders in children.Table 8.2Risk Factors for Mental and Developmental Disorders in Children and Adolescents. Consequences of Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersThe consequences of these disorders include the impact during childhood and the persistence of mental ill health into adult life. In childhood, the impact is broad, encompassing the individual suffering of children, as well as the negative effects on their families and peers. This impact may include aggression toward other children and distraction of peers from learning. Children with mental and developmental disorders are at higher risk of mental and physical health problems in adulthood, as well as increased likelihood of unemployment, contact with law enforcement agencies, and need for disability support.Trends in Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersGBD 2010 estimated burden across five time points (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) and found that the prevalence and burden of childhood mental disorders remained consistent between 1990 and 2010 (Erskine and others 2015). Although the rates may not have changed, population growth and aging have impacts on the burden of disease attributable to mental disorders in childhood. As the population of children increases globally, the burden of disease attributable to mental disorders in children will increase.Interventions for Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersPopulation Platform InterventionsChild and Adolescent Mental Health Policies and PlansFew countries have developed national policies and plans to address mental and developmental disorders in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a modular package for governments, policy makers, and service planners, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Policies and Plans, to address this need (WHO 2005b). The guidelines recommend attention to a broad range of areas pertaining to childhood mental and developmental disorders (box 8.1). The provision of health services for children in isolation will not prevent mental and developmental disorders or have significant benefits for children with these disorders. Instead, an ecological approach that addresses problems in the systems around children (parents, family, and school) in combination with targeted interventions for children is necessary to make a meaningful difference (Kieling and others 2011).Box 8.1Areas for Action for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.
