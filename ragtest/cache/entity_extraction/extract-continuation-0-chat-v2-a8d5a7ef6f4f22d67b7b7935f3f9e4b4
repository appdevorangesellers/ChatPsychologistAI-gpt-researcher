The clinical validity of intellectual disability disorder may also be debated by forensic mental health experts when an individual seems to meet diagnostic criteria in the absence of supporting documentation from the neurodevelopmental period. The absence of such information is particularly important when forensic psychiatrists evaluate institutionalized adults who demonstrate obvious intellectual impairment and deficits in adaptive functioning and who lack supporting educational and medical documentation to affirm the diagnosis. DSM-5's emphasis on clinical impression and adaptive functioning in the diagnosis of intellectual disability disorder is likely to increase forensic psychiatry's role in courtroom testimony regarding affected and allegedly affected individuals. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: A New Childhood Disorder One of the most significant additions to DSM-5 diagnoses is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new mood disorder classified in the depressive disorders section but exclusive to children and adolescents. This disorder may be identified in individuals who have persistent irritability or anger and recurrent episodes (on average three times per week) of developmentally inappropriate verbal or behavioral dyscontrol. The symptoms start before age 10 years, the diagnosis is made between ages 6 and 18, and the disorder causes significant impairment. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was introduced due to “considerable concern” (Ref. 1, p 157) that some children with this symptom profile are overdiagnosed with and treated for bipolar disorder. However, researchers who study bipolar disorder in children and adolescents found that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder could not be distinguished from oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder and lacked substantial diagnostic stability.17,22 In addition, some in the research community questioned the diagnostic utility of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in clinical populations.22,23 The initial diagnostic criteria proposed for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder were revised, perhaps in response to these concerns, to improve the utility and validity of the diagnosis. The resultant criteria more clearly distinguished disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder. Individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have persistent symptoms, whereas youths with bipolar disorder have discrete episodes of mania or hypomania. In other words, the duration of mood symptoms is the benchmark that distinguishes the two disorders. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are more likely to develop unipolar depressive disorders and anxiety disorders and thus should be treated if they are depressed, not manic or psychotic.24,–,26 The change in treatment protocol may reduce the frequency of prescribing atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium, and other medications for bipolar disorder in children, thereby improving treatment response rates and reducing the risk of more serious medication side effects. Treating youths with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also reduce the likelihood that, in the event of a first psychotic and/or manic episode, medications that are used to treat these disorders will obfuscate their clinical presentation. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will play a significant role in child forensic psychiatry, especially where at-risk and justice-involved youths are concerned. A subgroup of individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are caught up in the juvenile justice system because of allegations of domestic violence, assault, and resisting arrest, among other offenses. Early identification and treatment of these youths with antidepressants and other interventions may contain their behavior and delay the onset or reduce the frequency of involvement with the judicial system, by raising the threshold beyond which they become aggressive. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders Research into the genetics, neuroscience, and neuroimaging of anxiety disorders supports differences in heritability of disorders that are based on fear (phobias), obsessions and compulsions, dissociation, and trauma. The DSM-5, therefore, has assigned a separate chapter to each of these groups of anxiety disorders. The trauma- and stressor-related disorders group includes several diagnoses, defined somewhat differently than in DSM-IV, including reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder, that have significant implications for children and adolescents and for forensic practice. Forensic mental health experts may be asked to comment on the quality or consequences of attachment in cases involving child welfare services, child custody and adoption, juvenile delinquency, criminal responsibility, and capital sentencing, where attachment between the defendant and his caretaker may be presented as an aggravating or a mitigating factor. Disorders associated with social neglect (e.g., deficient caretaking during childhood, especially during the first months of life) may result in deficits in parent-child attachment. However, the trauma- and stressor-related disorders section of DSM-5 contains an advisory about assessing attachment in individuals who are from cultures in which attachment has not been studied; the diagnosis should be assigned with caution. The Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders group also includes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). DSM-5 provides a list of diagnostic criteria that are specific to children six years of age or younger that describes reenactment of trauma in play and dissociative responses to trauma. The difficulty of determining whether recurring distressing dreams in young children are related to traumatic incidents is also discussed. In children and adolescents, the symptoms in Criterion E for PTSD, including marked alterations in arousal and reactivity, such as irritable behavior, angry outbursts without much provocation, and self-destructive behavior (thrill-seeking, high-risk behavior, and reckless behavior leading to accidental harm to self or others) (Ref. 1, p 272), may result in referrals to mental health professionals, especially in justice-involved youths. The diagnostic criteria will facilitate identification of aggressive youths who may benefit from evidence-based clinical interventions for PTSD\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association that provides standardized criteria for the classification of mental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISRUPTIVE MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is a new mood disorder classified in the depressive disorders section of DSM-5, exclusive to children and adolescents, characterized by persistent irritability and recurrent episodes of verbal or behavioral dyscontrol.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Forensic mental health experts are professionals who evaluate individuals in legal contexts, often providing testimony regarding mental health conditions and their implications in court cases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The juvenile justice system is a legal framework that addresses the behavior of minors who are accused of committing crimes, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANXIETY DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health disorders characterized by significant feelings of anxiety and fear, which can affect daily functioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA- AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>This group of disorders includes diagnoses related to the experience of trauma and stress, such as PTSD, and has significant implications for children and adolescents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, characterized by severe anxiety, flashbacks, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD WELFARE SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Child welfare services are government and non-profit organizations that provide support and protection for children and families, often involved in cases of abuse or neglect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD CUSTODY<|>EVENT<|>Child custody refers to the legal determination of where a child will live and who will make decisions about their upbringing, often a contentious issue in divorce and separation cases.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUVENILE DELINQUENCY<|>EVENT<|>Juvenile delinquency refers to the participation of minors in illegal behavior, which can lead to involvement in the juvenile justice system.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGGRESSIVE YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>Aggressive youths are minors who exhibit behaviors that are hostile or violent, often leading to conflicts with the law or other individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mental health professionals are trained individuals who provide care and treatment for mental health issues, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISRUPTIVE MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER<|>DSM-5<|>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is a new diagnosis introduced in the DSM-5, highlighting its significance in mental health classification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS<|>DISRUPTIVE MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER<|>Forensic mental health experts may be called to evaluate individuals diagnosed with Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder in legal contexts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>AGGRESSIVE YOUTHS<|>Aggressive youths often become involved in the juvenile justice system due to their behaviors<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA- AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is classified under trauma- and stressor-related disorders, indicating a direct relationship<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILD WELFARE SERVICES<|>CHILD CUSTODY<|>Child welfare services often deal with cases that involve child custody determinations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS<|>FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS<|>Forensic mental health experts are a subset of mental health professionals who specialize in legal evaluations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANXIETY DISORDERS<|>TRAUMA- AND STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS<|>Anxiety disorders can be related to trauma- and stressor-related disorders, as trauma can lead to anxiety symptoms<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
