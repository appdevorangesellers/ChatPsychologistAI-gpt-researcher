The manuals consisted of education, parenting skills training, child training, and cognitive and behavioral therapy. These were adapted for local communities with attention to terminology, modifications to reduce stigma, and emphasis on culturally acceptable parenting skills. The feedback received from these sites indicates that the interventions were useful in helping children with internalizing and externalizing problems (Bauermeister and others 2006). Strategies to improve access to community-based interventions require investments in gatekeepers, such as parents, teachers, and general practitioners. Easy-to-read manuals and guides with culturally adapted strategies for the management of childhood mental disorders through nonspecialist primary care can be useful resources for practitioners seeking to develop services in such settings (Eapen, Graham, and Srinath 2012).Most preventive interventions implemented in early childhood in LMICs target child development generally, rather than child mental health specifically. However, increasing evidence shows that some of these early interventions can benefit the mental health of children, with benefits maintained into adolescence and adulthood. In Jamaica, an early stimulation program for very undernourished children, which involved home visits over two years, reduced anxiety, depression, and attention deficit disorder, and enhanced self-esteem at ages 17–18 years (Walker and others 2010). In Mauritius, two years of high-quality preschool, from age three years, reduced conduct disorder and schizotypal symptoms at age 17 years and criminal offenses at age 23 years (Raine and others 2003). These benefits were greatest for children who were undernourished at age three years. Such interventions can be integrated with community-based maternal child health programs and should be prioritized in LMICs (Kieling and others 2011).School-Based InterventionsSchools have a profound influence on children, families, and communities. School-based mental health services also have the potential to bridge the gap between need and utilization by reaching children who would otherwise not have access to these services. These settings could provide an ideal environment in which programs for child mental health can be integrated in a cost-effective, culturally acceptable, and nonstigmatizing manner (Patel, Aronson, and Divan 2013). However, the evidence for school-based interventions for childhood mental and developmental problems in LMICs is limited (Kieling and others 2011; Maulik and Darmstadt 2007).In Jamaica, Baker-Henningham and others (2012) conducted a cluster randomized control trial of 225 children (ages 3–6 years) with high levels of emotional and behavioral problems, attending 24 community preschool centers. The study examined the effectiveness of teacher training in “The Incredible Years,” a children’s mental health program. The intervention led to significant reductions in conduct problems (effect size [ES] = 0.42) and increased friendship skills (ES = 0.74). School attendance and parent-reported behavior at home also improved (Baker-Henningham and others 2012). This study demonstrates that school-based interventions in a middle-income country are effective and feasible in reducing behavioral problems in young children.Bullying or peer victimization is a specific form of aggression defined as “a form of aggression in which one or more children repeatedly and intentionally intimidate, harass, or physically harm a victim” (Vreeman and Carroll 2007). The long-term impacts of bullying behavior are serious; children who are victims, bullies, or both have elevated rates of psychiatric disorders in childhood and early adulthood (Copeland and others 2013). Accordingly, the prevention of peer victimization in schools is an important strategy to reduce the occurrence of mental disorders and other adverse consequences in children and adults.Different approaches to reducing bullying behavior have been assessed in the literature. In one systematic review, Vreeman and Carroll (2007) grouped the interventions into three main types: curriculum interventions, whole-of-school approaches, and social and behavioral skills training. Whole-of-school approaches have been found to be effective; these approaches use a multidisciplinary approach that includes combinations of school rules and sanctions, classroom curriculum, teacher training, individual counseling, and conflict resolution training. In a meta-analysis, Ttofi and Farrington (2011) found that school-based anti-bullying programs can reduce bullying by about 20 percent, with greater effects observed in interventions that adopt more of a whole-of-school approach. However, very few, if any, evaluations of interventions to prevent bullying have been conducted in LMICs.Further research is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of school-based interventions supporting children with autism and intellectual disability.Voluntary Sector ProgramsAgencies in the voluntary sector (those that are nongovernment and not for-profit) have traditionally played an important role in raising awareness of the issues faced by children with mental health difficulties and their families, as well as in reducing the associated stigma. In some countries, the voluntary sector provides the bulk of child mental health services. However, the evidence base for such interventions is poor, largely because of the absence of research support for program evaluation. The magnitude of mental health problems affecting children and the absence of policies to guide service development are significant barriers to coordinated service provision and evaluation of voluntary sector programs for children in LMICs (Omigbodun 2008; Patel and Thara 2003).Health Care Platform InterventionsScreening and Community Rehabilitation for Developmental DisordersProviding early interventions to children with developmental disorders may optimize their developmental outcomes (Sonnander 2000). Screening is necessary to identify children in need of these resource-intensive interventions. Screening instruments for LMICs need to be culturally acceptable and have sound psychometric properties that have been validated in the local context (Robertson and others 2012).\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
