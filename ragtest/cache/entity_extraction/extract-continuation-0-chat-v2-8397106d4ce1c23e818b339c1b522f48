These changes were made because recollection of childhood symptoms by adults “tends to be unreliable” (Ref. 1, p 61). Examples are provided to aid with diagnosing AD/HD in older individuals. Forensic psychiatrists are likely to consult on cases involving AD/HD when individuals have been denied supportive services in primary or secondary school or reasonable accommodations in college or the workplace. Criminal court cases involving possession of stimulants, the ability of an individual with AD/HD to follow and comprehend legal proceedings without stimulant therapy (which is not generally prescribed in adult penal institutions due to, among other things, security concerns associated with narcotics), and psychosis related to stimulant use may involve psychiatric expert evaluation and testimony. Lowering the diagnostic threshold is likely to increase the number of requests for forensic psychiatric consultation in civil litigation, workplace and education accommodation reviews, and disability benefit petitions. Specific Learning Disorder Learning disorders is another area in which there are fewer diagnoses in DSM-5 than in DSM-IV. In DSM-5 several DSM-IV learning disorders have been consolidated into a single diagnosis, specific learning disorder. Specifiers will be used to identify domains of restricted educational progress. For example, the diagnosis formerly called reading disorder is now specific learning disorder with impairment in reading. Specific learning disorder, which tends to be apparent in most affected individuals during the early school years, persists even when the affected individual is able to maintain average achievement “by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support” (Ref. 1, p 69). The diagnosis also may be made when a person who is intellectually gifted demonstrates “unexpected academic underachievement” (Ref. 1, p 69) or uses “compensatory strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support” (Ref. 1, p 69) to sustain satisfactory achievement but shows impairment when barriers, such as timed examinations, impede his capacity to achieve (Ref. 1, p 69). Individuals with specific learning disorder may become involved in legal proceedings when the need for supportive services or reasonable accommodations in education, employment, or community settings is disputed. Litigation involving the validity of contracts, crisis management, harassment, discrimination, and adjudicative competence may also illuminate how specific learning disorder impedes an affected individual's ability to function in society. The prevalence of comorbidity in individuals with specific learning disorder may also result in forensic psychiatrists' assessing affected individuals and testifying during adjudicative capacity and criminal responsibility hearings. The diagnostic changes in DSM-5 will present new challenges for forensic psychiatrists in courtrooms and elsewhere, since a subgroup of evaluees who are from different cultures and who may have experienced social or educational deprivation will no longer be eligible for educational and workplace supportive services based on DSM-5 criteria for specific learning disorder. Forensic psychiatrists also will be put in the position of explaining to judges, employers, and education administrators why gifted individuals who meet DSM-5 criteria for specific learning disorder may now be eligible for those same interventions. The changes are likely to result in lively debate for forensic mental health professionals in court testimony and policy debates. Intellectual Disability and Mental Retardation Although DSM-5 avoids using terminology that blurs the lines between clinical practice and the law, there are exceptions to this principle. In 2010, Rosa's Law18 replaced the term mental retardation with intellectual disability as a matter of U.S. federal law. In keeping with this change, DSM-5 has also replaced the diagnosis mental retardation with intellectual disability, and the nomenclature in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)19 is intellectual developmental disorder. In the text, the latter diagnosis is placed in parentheses and listed after the DSM-5 diagnosis, to facilitate the transition from DSM coding to the ICD-10 coding structure (Ref. 1, p 12). The term mental retardation has been widely considered stigmatizing, and the change in nomenclature marks a step forward in our awareness of and approach to understanding intellectual disability as a limitation that may be responsive, at times, to therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation. The elimination of the multiaxial diagnostic system in DSM-5 will also serve to lessen stigmatization, as it results in the removal of intellectual disorders diagnoses from Axis II, where they shared a somewhat stigmatizing position with the personality disorder diagnoses. DSM-5 specifiers for intellectual disability (mild, moderate, severe, and profound) have not changed from DSM-IV. DSM-5 provides a table and examples of deficits listed in three domains of adaptive functioning: conceptual (academic), social, and practical. These domains all have implications for forensic evaluators. For example, adults with mild intellectual disability may have conceptual deficits in abstract reasoning, managing money, executive functioning, and short-term memory. They may have a limited capacity to appreciate risk in social situations and may be more gullible than their same-age peers. They may also need help with practical skills, such as making health care and legal decisions and performing a skilled job competently. DSM-5 stresses the importance of norming tests to account for cultural variances and an examinee's native language. This may be an important consideration for forensic psychiatrists who consult in cases involving immigrants where a diagnosis of intellectual disability is being considered or applied, such as a disability claim or a petition for a workplace accommodation. Some individuals may malinger intellectual disability disorder to avoid legal consequences. It may be more challenging to detect malingering in an individual who is from a culture or who speaks a language with which the forensic mental health professional is not familiar. DSM-5 also describes the circumstances under which a child who has been diagnosed with intellectual disability benefits from interventions that significantly improve adaptive functioning, “such that the diagnosis of Intellectual Disability is no longer appropriate” (Ref. 1,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AD/HD<|>EVENT<|>AD/HD refers to Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, a condition that affects individuals' ability to focus and control impulses, often diagnosed in childhood but can persist into adulthood.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which provides standardized criteria for the classification of mental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROSA'S LAW<|>EVENT<|>Rosa's Law is a U.S. federal law enacted in 2010 that replaced the term \"mental retardation\" with \"intellectual disability\" to reduce stigma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY<|>EVENT<|>Intellectual disability is a term used to describe limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, replacing the outdated term \"mental retardation.\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Forensic psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry that intersects with the legal system, often involving the assessment of individuals in legal contexts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Specific learning disorder is a diagnosis in DSM-5 that consolidates several learning disorders into one, indicating difficulties in academic skills.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL VARIANCES<|>EVENT<|>Cultural variances refer to the differences in cultural backgrounds that can affect the understanding and diagnosis of mental health conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALINGERING<|>EVENT<|>Malingering is the act of intentionally faking or exaggerating symptoms for personal gain, often seen in legal contexts.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AD/HD<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>Forensic psychiatrists often consult on cases involving individuals with AD/HD, especially in legal settings where supportive services are denied<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 provides the criteria for diagnosing specific learning disorder, which is a key focus in educational and legal contexts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROSA'S LAW<|>INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY<|>Rosa's Law changed the terminology from mental retardation to intellectual disability, impacting legal and medical documentation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY<|>Forensic psychiatrists assess individuals with intellectual disabilities in legal contexts, particularly regarding competency and responsibility<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>AD/HD<|>Forensic psychiatrists evaluate cases involving AD/HD, especially in relation to legal proceedings and accommodations<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL VARIANCES<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>Cultural variances can complicate forensic evaluations, particularly in cases involving immigrants and mental health diagnoses<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALINGERING<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>Forensic psychiatrists must be vigilant for malingering in individuals claiming intellectual disabilities or other mental health issues<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
