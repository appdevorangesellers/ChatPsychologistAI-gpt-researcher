And additionally,\ndropping out of college and higher levels of credit card debt\nare negatively associated with flourishing. These associa-\ntions between flourishing and perceived ability, debt bur-\nden, and educational attainment also have policy implica-\ntions. Keyes (2002) suggests that flourishing is positively\nassociated with better psychosocial functioning, overall\nhealth, and well-being of individuals. Asebedo et al. (2020)\nfound that implementing positive psychology-based inter-\nventions can be effective in improving peoples’ financial\nself-efficacy, their overall financial well-being. LeBaron et\nal. (2019) found that experiential learning was an impor-\ntant tool for financial socialization. Financial socialization-\nrelated practices by parents, such as opening a bank account\nfor their children and regularly monitoring their children’s\nspending, were positively associated with better financial\npractices among young adults as they grew older (Kim &\nChatterjee, 2013). Perhaps, creating greater access to finan-\ncial education opportunities that integrate experiential learn-\ning into the curriculum could be beneficial in building con-\nfidence in young adults’ perception of their abilities to man-\nage money and debt. Creating campus-based programs that\nencourage college and high school students to complete\ntheir studies, provide financial education opportunities, and\neducate them to practice positive financial management can\nbe useful strategies that may be useful in improving the\nflourishing state of mind among young adults.\nReferences\nI\nD\n:\nt\ni\n0\n1\n3\n5\nAboagye, J., & Jung, J.
