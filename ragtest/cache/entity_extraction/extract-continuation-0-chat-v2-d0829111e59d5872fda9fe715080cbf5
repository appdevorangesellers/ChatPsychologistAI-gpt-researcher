PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC9352895 PMID: 35935425 Abstract Children exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and pervasive interpersonal traumas may go on to develop PTSD and, in most cases, will further undergo a significant shift in their developmental trajectory. This paper examines contemporary research on Developmental Trauma (DT), which is inextricably linked to disruptions in social cognition, physiological and behavioral regulation, and parent-child attachments. Developmental trauma associated with early experiences of abuse or neglect leads to multi-faceted and longstanding consequences and underscores critical periods of development, complex stress-mediated adaptations, and multilevel, trans-theoretical influences in the diagnostic formulation and treatment of traumatized children, adolescents, and adults. Psychological and medical correlates of Developmental Trauma Disorder are considered, and directions for future research are discussed. Keywords: developmental trauma disorder, complex trauma, adverse childhood experiences, PTSD, Bronfenbrenner's There has been much interest in understanding the prevalence and impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which refer to potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood and adolescence (e.g., abuse, rejection, and abandonment by caregivers; loss of a caregiver; interpersonal violence exposure). Recent developments suggest that multiple, repeated experiences of ACEs and interpersonal traumas have broad, cumulative, and lasting effects [e.g., (1, 2)]. Children are more likely than adults to lack the cognitive and behavioral capacities to understand and respond to traumatic circumstances effectively. Children affected by interpersonal trauma often experience more global and profound changes than adults who conceivably have more developed adaptations to stress and more cognitive resources to mitigate risks and promote resiliency. The current article provides discussion of how early, repeated interpersonal traumas can interrupt the development of secure attachment and precipitate the emergence of chronic and severe traumatic adaptations, followed by an analysis of contemporary research, conceptual and diagnostic issues, and assessment and treatment. The paper concludes with a discussion about future directions for research and practice. Trauma and PTSD Children and adults who have experienced trauma and developed measurable mental health symptoms associated with the trauma may present with indications of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that warrant careful diagnostic evaluation. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder brought on by exposure to a highly stressful and potentially life-threatening event such as a natural disaster, motor vehicle accident, witnessing family or community violence, experiencing abuse and neglect, or losing a loved one. The symptoms of PTSD, as defined by the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, are characterized by persistent and intrusive thoughts, hyperarousal (i.e., heightened startle in response to unexpected sounds or movements), deliberate avoidance of trauma reminders, and alterations to conscious awareness (i.e., dissociation, derealization, and depersonalization). Persistent trauma symptoms (i.e., that last longer than a month after the traumatic event(s) and are accompanied by social, behavioral, and academic impairments) indicate the presence of PTSD and differentiate it from other psychiatric disturbances [e.g., (3)]. Healthcare providers widely use the DSM-5 to determine whether a person's symptoms are severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD. However, individuals exposed to ACEs, pervasive interpersonal traumas, and polyvictimization [multiple, repeated ACEs; (4–8)] may not only go on to develop PTSD, but may also undergo significant shifts in their developmental trajectories. The changes are often widespread, adversely affecting their biological, social, cognitive, emotional, and spiritual/existential development (1, 9–11). Moreover, these experiences tend to threaten core beliefs and assumptions, including their self-esteem as well as their sense of lovability, vulnerability, and faith in family, friendships, and a higher power. Trauma survivors often face lifelong challenges in developing and maintaining trusting relationships; building and utilizing healthy coping strategies; and adjusting to school and, eventually, the workplace (12–14). For example, ACEs positively predict PTSD, recurrent depression, and repeated suicide attempts (15–17), and findings from several meta-analyses consistently link ACEs to enduring and debilitating psychiatric and physical health disorders (1, 18). It has been suggested that individuals who have experienced ACEs often view the world as unfair and to blame for their circumstances, resulting in reoccurring helplessness and hopelessness about life and relationships, including their ability to make a positive and meaningful impact. Indeed, retrospective studies with adults reveal that 50–60% of adults have a history of childhood abuse or neglect that has impacted their emotional development, their core assumptions about themselves and their worlds, and their functioning as adults (19, 20). Children and PTSD Research suggests that children and adolescents who experienced significant early interpersonal trauma often receive inaccurate or incomplete diagnoses later in life [thereby leading to various treatments for co-occurring psychiatric disorders that may not be effective; (21, 22)]. Scholars spanning a broad range of scientific disciplines have asserted that this is due to significant limitations in the DSM's PTSD classification system (23–28). Repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents share overlapping symptoms of PTSD; however, experiences of prolonged trauma during sensitive periods of development are more detrimental to children, given their age, limited cognitive capacities, and dependency on caregivers. A new conceptualization of trauma—specifically the construct of complex trauma—was developed for repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents who often have high comorbidities between trauma and other disorders, which are underestimated by PTSD diagnostic criteria (29–31). From this perspective, the diagnosis of PTSD only accounts for a limited portion of the symptoms experienced by individuals who have experienced childhood trauma. These individuals often demonstrate broader and more severe health problems, social and economic adversity (including poverty and homelessness, psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration), and medical and psychiatric comorbidities as well as persistent negative views of themselves, others, and their\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Developmental Trauma refers to the impact of adverse childhood experiences and interpersonal traumas on an individual's development, leading to PTSD and other long-term consequences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event, characterized by symptoms such as intrusive thoughts and hyperarousal.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>EVENT<|>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic events occurring in childhood that can lead to significant emotional and psychological issues later in life.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is a manual used by healthcare providers to diagnose mental health disorders, including PTSD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Children are individuals in the developmental stage of life who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of trauma and adverse experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>Adults are individuals who have reached maturity and may experience long-term effects from childhood trauma, including PTSD and other mental health issues.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Developmental Trauma can lead to the development of PTSD in affected individuals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Experiencing Adverse Childhood Experiences is linked to a higher likelihood of developing PTSD<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Adverse Childhood Experiences contribute to the onset of Developmental Trauma<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Children are more likely to experience Adverse Childhood Experiences, which can impact their development<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADULTS<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Adults often have a history of Adverse Childhood Experiences that affect their emotional development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Children who experience trauma may develop PTSD, impacting their mental health<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADULTS<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Adults with a history of childhood trauma may present with PTSD symptoms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 is used to diagnose PTSD based on specific criteria<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
