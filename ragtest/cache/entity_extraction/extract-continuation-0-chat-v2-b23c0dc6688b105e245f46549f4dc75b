The changes in the PTSD diagnostic criteria may increase the likelihood that child forensic psychiatrists will be asked to testify about PTSD and aggression in school, special education, individualized education programs (IEPs), and expulsion hearings and in juvenile court waiver or bindover and disposition or sentencing hearings. When youths who have been exposed to severe trauma engage in aggressive, risky, or thrill-seeking behavior and appear to be callous and unemotional, judicial administrators may want to know whether the history of traumatization is contributing to the behavior and warrants mental health intervention. Child forensic psychiatrists may be increasingly retained to examine this question and to recommend therapeutic interventions for affected individuals. Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Conduct disorder is one of the only diagnoses in the DSM-5 that contains no exclusionary criteria for other clinically treatable diagnoses, and consequently, it may lend itself to diagnosis by lay persons who lack facility with clinical diagnoses. The diagnosis, which can also be made in adults, requires the affected individual to meet 3 of 15 criteria in one of four categories: aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violation of rules. One specifier, with limited prosocial emotions, merits further discussion. Individuals with limited prosocial emotions meet two of the following four criteria: lack of remorse or guilt about their behavior until they are caught; lack of empathy; seeming unconcerned about consequences of unsatisfactory academic, professional, or other achievement; and “shallow or deficient affect” (Ref. 1, p 471). These youths often misuse substances and have a higher rate of suicidal ideation and attempted and completed suicides (Ref. 1, p 473). The behavioral description of conduct disorder overlaps considerably with the behavior exhibited by individuals with psychosis, mood disorders, and PTSD. Also, many youths with conduct disorder become involved in the juvenile justice system, where the prevalence of mental disorders is higher than in the general population, even when conduct disorder is excluded.26 Perception of the limited prosocial emotions specifier has not been studied in juvenile court judges. However, when conduct disorder with callous and unemotional features was studied in mental health professionals who evaluate justice-involved youths, the response was both negative and punitive. This outcome has led to concerns about the influence of this specifier on mental health professionals and on the jurists and attorneys to whom they provide expert consultation.27 The facility with which the conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions diagnosis can be made increases the likelihood that other treatable diagnoses may be overlooked, as often happens when mental health services in juvenile corrections facilities are reviewed.28,29 The concern extends to youths charged with more serious offenses, whose cases are bound over or waived from juvenile to criminal court. These individuals tend to have more serious mental disorders than youths whose cases remain in the juvenile court system.30 Although defense attorneys have concerns about the adjudicative competence of youths who seem to lack the maturity to understand the legal process and to assist in their defense,31 immaturity is not considered a mental disease or defect for purposes of adjudicative incompetence.32 Juveniles also are more likely than adults to make false confessions.33 Consequently, in the United States, a youth with conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions may be adjudicated delinquent or bound over, even if he does not understand the legal process and has treatable mental disorders that have been overlooked. Although youths should not be absolved of responsibility for their actions, those with treatable mental disorders should not be overlooked, but rather should be placed in juvenile and other settings that foster mental health rehabilitation. For example, DSM-5 indicates that “individuals with conduct disorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders and substance-related disorders as adults” (Ref. 1, p 473). Nevertheless, in the discussion accompanying the diagnosis, the prevalence of these evolving mental disorders in children and adolescents is not discussed, and an opportunity to alert diagnosticians to the need for early identification of and interventions for affected individuals is missed. Conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions represents a defined condition that may alter the trajectory of the lives of youths who have undiagnosed but more treatable comorbid disorders. The absence of exclusionary criteria illuminates the dangers associated with using DSM-5 inappropriately in forensic settings. It also suggests that, in rare cases, it may unintentionally contribute to adverse outcomes, even when it is used for its intended purpose. DSM-5 and Legal Practice Although there are many changes in DSM-5 that may enhance how mental disorders are classified and studied, one thing has not changed: the danger of legal professionals, policy makers, and others using The Manual to advance legal, political, and nonmedical agendas. It is important, therefore, for child forensic psychiatrists to be familiar with the “Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” (Ref. 1, p 25). DSM-5 is not intended for legal use. Legal professionals who use the text to address matters pertaining to children and adolescents risk misinterpreting or misusing the information. The child and adolescent forensic mental health professional who is cognizant of the “imperfect fit between legal questions to be addressed and questions of ultimate concern to the law” (Ref. 1, p 25) is in an excellent position to remind legal professionals of the drawbacks associated with using the DSM-5 in resolving legal questions. Conclusion Classification of mental disorders is based on a growing body of research in the clinical and biological sciences that makes periodic re-evaluation of diagnoses necessary. In the case of some diagnoses, such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, diagnostic changes may result in identification of youths who can be\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is a manual used for the classification of mental disorders, which is not intended for legal use but is often referenced in forensic settings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Child forensic psychiatrists are mental health professionals who evaluate and provide recommendations regarding the mental health of youths involved in legal matters.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUVENILE COURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Juvenile court is a legal system that deals with minors who have been accused of committing a crime, often focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Conduct disorder is a mental health diagnosis characterized by a pattern of behavior that violates societal norms and the rights of others, often leading to legal issues for youths.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Trauma refers to the emotional and psychological response to distressing events, which can significantly impact a child's mental health and behavior.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGGRESSION<|>EVENT<|>Aggression is a behavior characterized by hostile or violent actions, which can be a symptom of underlying mental health issues such as PTSD or conduct disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION<|>EVENT<|>Mental health intervention involves therapeutic measures taken to address psychological issues, particularly in youths with conduct disorder or trauma exposure.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The juvenile justice system is a legal framework that addresses offenses committed by minors, focusing on rehabilitation and mental health support.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>JUVENILE COURT<|>Child forensic psychiatrists provide expert consultation to juvenile court regarding the mental health of youths involved in legal proceedings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION<|>Conduct disorder often necessitates mental health intervention to address the underlying issues and behaviors associated with the diagnosis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA<|>AGGRESSION<|>Exposure to trauma can lead to aggressive behavior in youths, which may be evaluated in juvenile court<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>Youths with conduct disorder are often involved in the juvenile justice system due to their behaviors<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>Child forensic psychiatrists utilize the DSM-5 for diagnosing mental disorders in youths, despite its limitations in legal contexts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUVENILE COURT<|>MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION<|>Juvenile court may mandate mental health intervention for youths diagnosed with conduct disorder<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
