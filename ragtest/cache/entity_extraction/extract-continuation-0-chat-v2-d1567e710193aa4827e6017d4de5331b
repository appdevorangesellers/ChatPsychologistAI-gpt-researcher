Recommended system-wide policies and procedures include enhanced and coordinated evaluation protocols, formal response training, long-term care initiatives, and community engagement aimed at recognizing, supporting, and treating those with DTD (210â€“212). In sum, research studies have established that developmental trauma confers significant risks to the health and wellbeing of those who have experienced early, repeated interpersonal traumas. Disturbances in attachment, emotion regulation, self-perception, and worldview assumptions are precipitated by trauma and cause a broad range of correlated psychological and medical disorders. Future studies are needed to reconcile several outstanding questions related to ACEs. For example, psychometric investigations of individuals who have experienced ACEs raise the possibility that additional typologies may be present [e.g., borderline personality and resilient subgroupings; (66, 213)]. Another avenue for research concerns the possibility that complex trauma is correlated with multiple sensitive periods, particularly for individuals who have been subjected to prolonged violence exposure. Lastly, although ACEs have been widely studied and consistently predict traumatic responses in adults, the construct encompasses a broad range of adversities, such as parent divorce, sexual assault, and neglect, which may confer different traumatic adaptations.Author contributions DC was responsible for the conceptualization, organization, and final draft of the manuscript.
