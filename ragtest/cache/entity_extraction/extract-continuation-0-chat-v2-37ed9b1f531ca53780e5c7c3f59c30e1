Although some changes are welcome and needed, others have been controversial. In this article, I examine the diagnostic changes along with some of the associated controversies and resolutions. The implications for the practice of child forensic psychiatry, including problems that may be encountered by forensic psychiatrists who evaluate adults with childhood-onset mental disorders, are examined. The pitfalls associated with improper use of The Manual by legal professionals are also reviewed.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 represents the culmination of a multinational interdisciplinary effort to incorporate a body of empirical studies into a resource for classifying mental illness (Ref. 1, p.7). The DSM-5 Child and Adolescent Disorders Work Group was cognizant of the controversy surrounding their recommendation to reclassify several DSM-IV2 disorders, including some that affect children and adolescents. The contents of DSM-5, at times, reflect their responsiveness to those concerns.3In this article, I examine changes in DSM-5 regarding disorders that have their onset primarily in childhood and adolescence and I focus on disorders that are more likely to be encountered by child forensic psychiatrists in the course of practice. The discussion may also be of interest to forensic mental health professionals who work with adults who have childhood-onset mental disorders.The implications of a mental disorder in a child or adolescent are substantial. The disorder may interfere with normal development and the youth's efforts to relate to family and peers and to reach normal developmental milestones, such as becoming independent, caring for himself, interacting with peers, and obtaining an education. Therefore, identifying and addressing psychiatric disorders in children is imperative.Although the end of childhood has been legislatively defined for educational, legal, and other purposes, there is no evidence-based endpoint for the neurodevelopmental period. For this reason, DSM-5 contains no references to the age at which the neurodevelopmental period ends and adulthood begins. Yet, the point at which individuals are reasonably expected to transition from childhood to adulthood is the crux of many of the controversies involving psychiatric disorders, including those affecting children and adolescents. Many youths encounter challenges and setbacks as they navigate the social and educational systems on their way to independence. This can be a normal part of the developmental process and may be conducive to the refinement of coping skills, as well as the development of empathy and resilience. However, a setback may also be the manifestation of a mental disorder, when a change in biological, psychological, or developmental functioning results in a youth's enduring behavioral, cognitive, or emotional impairment (Ref. 1, p 20).Many of the disorders in DSM-5 that have their onset during childhood and adolescence, such as autism spectrum disorder, can be found in a chapter titled “Neurodevelopmental Disorders.” Others, including conduct disorder and reactive attachment disorder, are located elsewhere in The Manual. Neurocognitive disorders, which are acquired disorders that may affect children and adolescents but primarily are diagnosed in adults, will not be addressed in this article. Autism Spectrum Disorder The level of impairment experienced by individuals with pervasive developmental disorders, which are characterized by deficits in social interaction, varies from mild to severe. In DSM-IV, individuals with Asperger's disorder and those with autistic disorder show deficits in social interaction and restricted, repetitive behavior. Individuals with autistic disorder also have early signs of cognitive developmental delay and language deficits. The DSM-5 Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group determined that autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, were not being applied consistently and correctly by clinicians. This inconsistency was obfuscating efforts to understand these disorders and to identify effective treatment interventions. The Work Group addressed this concern by using a dimensional approach to reclassifying these five maladies as a single diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder. A table provided in DSM-5 in the neurodevelopmental disorders chapter (Ref. 1, pp 34–6) provides examples of the different levels of severity. Specifiers for autism spectrum disorder include whether there is accompanying intellectual or language impairment or an association with a medical or genetic condition or environmental factor; with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder; or with catatonia. Thus, for example, in the absence of intellectual impairment, the DSM-5 diagnosis for a person with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Asperger's disorder is autism spectrum disorder without intellectual impairment and without structural language impairment. The decision to subsume Asperger's disorder as part of autism spectrum disorder has been controversial. Many clinicians, teachers, parents, and advocates fear that the change will stigmatize individuals with Asperger's disorder because autism historically has been thought of as a more severe disease.3,–,5 This concern has been particularly troubling in regard to high-functioning individuals with Asperger's disorder who have learned to adapt in the classroom, workplace, and elsewhere; some affected individuals have even managed to function without accommodations and without disclosing the diagnosis. Although Asperger's disorder is no longer a separate diagnosis, individuals and clinicians may continue\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is a comprehensive resource for classifying mental illness, incorporating empirical studies and revisions for children and adolescents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DISORDERS WORK GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 Child and Adolescent Disorders Work Group is responsible for the classification and diagnostic criteria of mental disorders affecting children and adolescents in the DSM-5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a diagnosis that encompasses various pervasive developmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and restricted, repetitive behaviors, reclassified in DSM-5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPBERGER'S DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Asperger's Disorder was previously a separate diagnosis characterized by social interaction deficits and restricted behaviors, now subsumed under Autism Spectrum Disorder in DSM-5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Child forensic psychiatry is a field that addresses the mental health needs of children and adolescents within the legal system, focusing on the implications of mental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>A mental disorder in children or adolescents can interfere with normal development and social interactions, necessitating identification and treatment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DISORDERS WORK GROUP<|>DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS<|>The Work Group developed the DSM-5, which includes revisions for classifying mental disorders in children and adolescents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>ASPBERGER'S DISORDER<|>Asperger's Disorder has been reclassified as part of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENTAL DISORDER<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY<|>Child forensic psychiatry addresses the implications of mental disorders in children and adolescents within the legal context<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
