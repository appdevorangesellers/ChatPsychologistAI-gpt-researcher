Although regional differences may exist, the lack of data makes them difficult to ascertain. The 12-month global prevalence of childhood mental disorders in 2010 is shown in table 8.1. ADHD, conduct disorder, and autism were more prevalent in males; females were more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders and ADHD were more common in adolescents compared with children.Table 8.1Global Point Prevalence of Childhood Mental and Developmental Disorders by Gender and Total Number of Cases, 2010. Most children and adolescents with mental and developmental disorders were in South Asia, reflecting the high population in this region and the reduction in mortality of infants and young children (Murray and others 2012). The populations of LMICs tend to have higher proportions of children and adolescents than those of high-income countries (HICs). For example, 40 percent of the population in the least developed countries is younger than age 15 years, compared with 17 percent in more developed regions (United Nations 2011). Furthermore, population aging is occurring more slowly in LMICs, with some low-income countries predicted to have the youngest populations by 2050, given their high fertility rates (United Nations 2011). These trends mean that childhood mental and developmental disorders will increase in significance in LMICs. Furthermore, the continuing reductions in infant mortality caused by infectious diseases mean more children will reach adolescence where the prevalence of mental disorders increases and the onset of adult mental disorders occurs. This will challenge already limited mental health services in these countries.Risk Factors for Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersThe risk factors for childhood mental and developmental disorders shown in table 8.2 can be divided into lifelong and age-specific risk factors (Kieling and others 2011). The health of children is highly dependent on the health and well-being of their caregivers; the environments in which the children live (including home and school); and, as they transition into adolescence, the influence of their peers. The relative importance of a particular risk factor should be considered in terms of prevalence, strength of the association with an adverse outcome, and potential to reduce exposure to that risk factor (Scott and others 2014). Using these criteria, efforts to address maternal mental health problems and improve parenting skills have the greatest potential to reduce mental and developmental disorders in children.Table 8.2Risk Factors for Mental and Developmental Disorders in Children and Adolescents. Consequences of Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersThe consequences of these disorders include the impact during childhood and the persistence of mental ill health into adult life. In childhood, the impact is broad, encompassing the individual suffering of children, as well as the negative effects on their families and peers. This impact may include aggression toward other children and distraction of peers from learning. Children with mental and developmental disorders are at higher risk of mental and physical health problems in adulthood, as well as increased likelihood of unemployment, contact with law enforcement agencies, and need for disability support.Trends in Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersGBD 2010 estimated burden across five time points (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) and found that the prevalence and burden of childhood mental disorders remained consistent between 1990 and 2010 (Erskine and others 2015). Although the rates may not have changed, population growth and aging have impacts on the burden of disease attributable to mental disorders in childhood. As the population of children increases globally, the burden of disease attributable to mental disorders in children will increase.Interventions for Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersPopulation Platform InterventionsChild and Adolescent Mental Health Policies and PlansFew countries have developed national policies and plans to address mental and developmental disorders in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a modular package for governments, policy makers, and service planners, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Policies and Plans, to address this need (WHO 2005b). The guidelines recommend attention to a broad range of areas pertaining to childhood mental and developmental disorders (box 8.1). The provision of health services for children in isolation will not prevent mental and developmental disorders or have significant benefits for children with these disorders. Instead, an ecological approach that addresses problems in the systems around children (parents, family, and school) in combination with targeted interventions for children is necessary to make a meaningful difference (Kieling and others 2011).Box 8.1Areas for Action for Child and Adolescent Mental Health. Financing Collaboration across sectorsChild Protection LegislationChild maltreatment is a well-established risk factor for mental and developmental disorders in children (Benjet, Borges, and Medina-Mora 2010). Child maltreatment is defined as any form of physical or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, or commercial or other exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to a child’s health, survival, development, or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power (Krug and others 2002). Legislation to address child maltreatment requires the support of well-integrated systems that increase public awareness and enable incident reporting to a constituted authority with investigative and interventional expertise and the ability to prosecute (Svevo-Cianci, Hart, and Rubinson 2010). Limited evidence suggests that legislation to protect children living outside the family home in LMICs has benefits for their health and safety (Fluke and others 2012); however, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such legislation for children living with their families of origin.Community Platform InterventionsEarly Child DevelopmentAttempts have been made to develop community- and primary care–based services in LMICs. Eickmann and others (2003) delivered a community-based psychosocial stimulation intervention to mothers in a study of 156 infants (age 12 months) in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
