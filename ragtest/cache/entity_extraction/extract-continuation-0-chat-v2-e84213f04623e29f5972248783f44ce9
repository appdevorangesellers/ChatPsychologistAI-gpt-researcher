Scott, The University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, Queensland; Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Queensland, Australia;Email: ua.vog.dlq.htlaeh@ttocs.semaj.IntroductionChildhood mental and developmental disorders encompass neurodevelopmental, emotional, and behavioral disorders that have broad and serious adverse impacts on psychological and social well-being. Children with these disorders require significant additional support from families and educational systems; the disorders frequently persist into adulthood (Nevo and Manassis 2009; Polanczyk and Rohde 2007; Shaw and others 2012). These children are more likely to experience a compromised developmental trajectory, with increased need for medical and disability services, as well as increased risk of contact with law enforcement agencies (Fergusson, Horwood, and Lynskey 1993).Childhood Mental and Behavioral DisordersThis chapter limits the discussion to the following five conditions: childhood anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, autism, and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive or inappropriate fear, with associated behavioral disturbances that impair functioning (APA 2013). Children with anxiety disorders have clinical symptoms, such as excessive anxiety; severe physiological anxiety symptoms; behavioral disturbances, such as avoidance of feared objects; and associated distress or impairment (Beesdo, Knappe, and Pine 2009).ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention and disorganization, with or without hyperactivity-impulsivity, causing impairment of functioning (APA 2013). ADHD persists into adulthood in approximately 20 percent of individuals (Polanczyk and Rohde 2007).Conduct disorder diagnosed in children under the age of 18 years is characterized by a pattern of antisocial behaviors that violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe impairment in reciprocal social interactions and communication skills, as well as the presence of restricted and stereotypical behaviors.Intellectual disability is a generalized disorder that is characterized by significantly impaired cognitive functioning and deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors (APA 2013).Scope of the ChapterThis chapter reviews interventions to reduce the prevalence of childhood mental and developmental disorders through the prevention, reduction, or remission of symptoms. The effectiveness of selected interventions is evidence based; these interventions have the potential to be delivered in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The chapter does not discuss childhood depression, because of the overlap in interventions with adult depression.The chapter considers interventions in terms of delivery platforms rather than specific disorders. This choice is because of the very high comorbidity between childhood mental and developmental disorders (Bakare 2012; Rutter 2011). In addition, risk factors for childhood disorders are nonspecific and pluripotent. For example, children who are maltreated are at higher risk of a wide range of mental and developmental disorders (Benjet, Borges, and Medina-Mora 2010).Nature of Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersChildhood mental and developmental disorders are an emerging challenge to health care systems globally. Two contributing factors are the increases in the proportion of children and adolescents in the populations of LMICs, which is a result of reduced mortality of children under age five years (Murray and others 2012), and the fact that the onset of many adult mental and developmental disorders occurs in childhood and adolescence (Kessler and others 2007).Global Epidemiology and the Burden of Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersAscertaining the global epidemiology of mental disorders is a difficult task, given the significant paucity of data for many geographical regions, as well as the cultural variations in presentation and measurement. These issues are exacerbated when investigating mental disorders in children, particularly in LMICs where other health concerns, such as infectious diseases, are priorities. The issue of data paucity was highlighted in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) (Whiteford and others 2013).Epidemiologically, childhood mental disorders were relatively consistent across the 21 world regions defined by GBD 2010. However, these prevalence estimates were based on sparse data; some regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, have no data whatsoever for some disorders or no data for specific disorders in childhood. Although regional differences may exist, the lack of data makes them difficult to ascertain. The 12-month global prevalence of childhood mental disorders in 2010 is shown in table 8.1. ADHD, conduct disorder, and autism were more prevalent in males; females were more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders and ADHD were more common in adolescents compared with children.Table 8.1Global Point Prevalence of Childhood Mental and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, also known as the World Bank, is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORLD BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Bank is a group of five international organizations that make loans to developing countries for economic development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES G SCOTT<|>PERSON<|>James G Scott is an author and researcher affiliated with The University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, focusing on childhood mental and developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATHRINE MIHALOPOULOS<|>PERSON<|>Cathrine Mihalopoulos is an author and researcher contributing to the study of childhood mental and developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLLY E ERSKINE<|>PERSON<|>Holly E Erskine is an author and researcher involved in the research of childhood mental and developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACQUELINE ROBERTS<|>PERSON<|>Jacqueline Roberts is an author and researcher contributing to the study of childhood mental and developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATIF RAHMAN<|>PERSON<|>Atif Rahman is an author and researcher focused on childhood mental and developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUEENSLAND<|>GEO<|>Queensland is a state in Australia where The University of Queensland is located, contributing to research on childhood mental and developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIA<|>GEO<|>Australia is a country where significant research on childhood mental and developmental disorders is being conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDHOOD MENTAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>Childhood mental and developmental disorders encompass a range of neurodevelopmental, emotional, and behavioral disorders that impact children's psychological and social well-being.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMES G SCOTT<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>James G Scott is affiliated with the World Bank, contributing to research on childhood mental and developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATHRINE MIHALOPOULOS<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>Cathrine Mihalopoulos is affiliated with the World Bank, contributing to research on childhood mental and developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLLY E ERSKINE<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>Holly E Erskine is affiliated with the World Bank, contributing to research on childhood mental and developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACQUELINE ROBERTS<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>Jacqueline Roberts is affiliated with the World Bank, contributing to research on childhood mental and developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATIF RAHMAN<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>Atif Rahman is affiliated with the World Bank, contributing to research on childhood mental and developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDHOOD MENTAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS<|>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT<|>The World Bank is involved in addressing childhood mental and developmental disorders through research and interventions<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDHOOD MENTAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS<|>AUSTRALIA<|>Research on childhood mental and developmental disorders is being conducted in Australia, particularly at The University of Queensland<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
