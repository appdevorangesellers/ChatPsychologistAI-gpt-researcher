Examples of public narratives emblematic of loss and resilience are also evident in the experiences of other historically oppressed cultural groups, including descendants of the Armenian genocide during the Ottoman Empire, descendants of Stalinist persecution in Russian, African American, and aboriginal or indigenous peoples across the world. It is not uncommon for these narratives to include experiences of genocide, forced relocation, enslavement, and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; often alongside narratives of resistance, survival, hope, and resilience (Baker & Gippenreiter, 1998; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Fullilove, 2005; Karenian et al., 2011; Kienzler, 2008; Pollack, 2003; Wexler et al., 2009).Historical trauma narratives response to disaster Although historical trauma has mostly been developed to explain the experiences of historically marginalized ethnic groups, the construct is also relevant to understanding individual and community health for groups who have experienced a natural disaster. As Cox and Perry (2011) note in describing how a large wildfire in British Columbia fundamentally altered the community psyche of the two towns most damaged by the fire, place-based traumas also engender public narratives that can impact health. Cox and Perry (2011) show how narratives portraying positive outcomes, such as strengthened sense of community, as well as negative ones, such as feelings of anxiety towards the stability and safety of place, were evident following this disaster. They also show how each of these narratives were related to people’s sense of place. In another example, Long and Wong (2012) describe how the tension between national and local sense of recovery time following the Wenchuan earthquake in China exacerbated a sense of communal trauma. Instead of allowing community members to recover from this disaster at a pace that accommodated their personal and public narratives, members were deluged with national support and public expectations for a speedy recovery that conflicted with these narratives, thus increasing negative health impacts following the disaster. Although these examples are not intergenerational, they illustrate how a place-based trauma can remain part of a community’s cultural identity through a prevailing public narrative of loss or resilience. Place-based historical trauma narratives can also encode resilience, as is evident by public responses to the great Chicago fire of 1871, which decimated the new city but fostered an altered public identity for its surviving residents and subsequent generations. Many Chicagoans take pride in referring to Chicago as “the second city” because it depicts how the city was rebuilt using brick (rather than wood) following the great fire, how it “[rose] from [its] ashes, a greater city than before” (Shaw, 1921, p. 177). Not only is the narrative one of resilience and thriving, but the mostly brick buildings throughout Chicago serve as a contemporary reminder that heightens the narrative salience of “the second city” and the resilience of its inhabitants. As Pollack (2003) notes based on his research in Bosnia-Herzegovina, mass trauma experiences can damage people’s relationships to place, but social acts and symbols that re-narrate the connection between physical and social environments can counteract the negative consequences of trauma. Regardless of whether the past traumas are felt based on place, ethnicity, or other social, cultural, or contextual groupings, the public narratives created in response to trauma influence one’s sense of identity.Conclusion History provides a narrative context within which contemporary social issues are interpreted. By incorporating a rich understanding of community or group history into social science research on health, we improve the local relevance and responsiveness of research findings and enhance the ability of interventions to leverage community-level and culturally-relevant strategies and variables (Trickett et al., 2011). Should the history contain trauma, the questions become in what ways the historical traumas may or may not be present or impactful and how we might as people and communities respond to these histories in order to promote resilience. Present-day political forces are increasingly calling for dominant cultures to apologize for historical traumas and document the “truth” of the traumas. In theory, truth commissions promise to repair damage of past abuses through rhetorical strategies that change the dominant cultural narrative to an admission of guilt and wrong doing (Edwards, 2010). Yet, research on the impact of truth commissions is mixed. Evidence from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission suggests that the commission improved general knowledge but had little to no impact on participant well-being (Kaminer, Stein, Mbanga, & Zungu-Dirwayi, 2001; Stein et al., 2008). Miller (2006) argues that for Canadian First Nations the social-political forms of these apologies may be incongruous with First Nations cultural practices and expectations of reconciliation, thereby limiting their benefit for the aggrieved cultures while benefiting (yet again) the dominant culture. The politics of apology and recognition are thorny—the “political economy of trauma” may do more to benefit the dominant cultures who are apologizing, maintaining their dominance and power, or may help usher in a new period of greater equality (James, 2004). We argue that studying narratives of historical trauma can help disentangle the ways in which contemporary actions perpetrate or repair historical wounds. Our critical review of historical trauma as a public narrative offers a framework for analyzing how historical traumas are relayed and connected to present-day contexts and health outcomes. Public narratives of historical trauma interact with contemporary reminders of these stories. The reminders serve to make the public narrative more or less salient to particular individuals, families, groups, and communities. The degree of narrative salience, in turn, influences the interpretation of an historical trauma response that manifests as a health impact. Importantly, we suggest that these linkages are recursive, that is, they operate in both directions such that the historical trauma narratives and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>EVENT<|>The Armenian Genocide refers to the mass extermination of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire, which has had lasting impacts on the descendants of survivors and their cultural narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>EVENT<|>Stalinist persecution involved the oppression and execution of various ethnic groups in Russia, affecting the descendants of those who suffered during this period.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>PERSON<|>African Americans are individuals of African descent living in the United States, many of whom have experienced historical trauma related to slavery and ongoing discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABORIGINAL PEOPLES<|>PERSON<|>Aboriginal peoples refer to the indigenous populations of various regions, who have faced historical trauma due to colonization and cultural suppression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH COLUMBIA<|>GEO<|>British Columbia is a province in Canada that experienced a large wildfire, which significantly impacted the community psyche of the towns affected.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE<|>EVENT<|>The Wenchuan earthquake was a devastating natural disaster in China that caused significant loss and trauma, affecting the recovery narratives of the local communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO FIRE<|>EVENT<|>The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was a major disaster that destroyed much of the city, leading to narratives of resilience and rebuilding among its residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Truth and Reconciliation Commissions are bodies established to address past human rights violations and promote healing through acknowledgment of historical traumas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST NATIONS<|>PERSON<|>First Nations refer to the various indigenous peoples in Canada, who have their own unique cultures and histories, often marked by experiences of trauma and resilience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>The Armenian Genocide and the experiences of African Americans both represent historical traumas that have shaped cultural narratives of resilience and loss<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>Both Stalinist persecution and the experiences of African Americans highlight the impact of historical oppression on cultural identity and narratives<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>ABORIGINAL PEOPLES<|>African Americans and Aboriginal peoples share experiences of historical trauma and ongoing discrimination, influencing their cultural narratives<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRITISH COLUMBIA<|>WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE<|>The wildfire in British Columbia and the Wenchuan earthquake both serve as examples of place-based traumas that affect community narratives and health<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO FIRE<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>The Great Chicago Fire and the historical experiences of African Americans both illustrate narratives of resilience following significant trauma<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION<|>FIRST NATIONS<|>Truth and Reconciliation Commissions aim to address historical traumas experienced by First Nations and promote healing through acknowledgment<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
