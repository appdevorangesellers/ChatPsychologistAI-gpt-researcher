They often show signs of a heightened startle reflex, dissociation, fear, and anxiety and are often unable to be soothed by others (171–173). For example, studies of children who have experienced trauma and polyvictimization suggest that these children display greater physiological reactivity to threats such as traumatic reminders than children who have not experienced trauma (174–177).\nClinical signs and symptoms of DTD\nChildren and adolescents with DTD may react with either over-modulated or under-modulated behaviors. Over-modulated children appear hyperactive and aggressive, whereas under-modulated children appear depressed, withdrawn, and possibly dissociative. Children and adolescents with DTD may be highly reactive to their environment (e.g., hypersensitive to sounds, touch, lights) or appear to be relatively indifferent to their immediate surroundings (80, 178). They may react to perceived threats with avoidance, tantrums, or anger, especially when they feel emotionally vulnerable or disempowered.\nWhen children or adolescents with symptoms consistent with DTD appear distractible, impulsive, and/or highly aggressive, these children are likely to be classified with ADHD (hyperactive and impulsive or combined subtype), conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and/or oppositional defiant disorder (179–182). These individuals may indeed meet diagnostic criteria for several of these psychiatric disorders, however, they may be secondary to DTD, and, as such, require different clinical evaluation and treatment approaches.\nOn the other hand, individuals with DTD who are anxious, withdrawn, dissociative, and rigid (adhering to strict behavioral routines) are more likely to be diagnosed (and sometimes misdiagnosed) with neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) because trauma symptoms such as emotional numbing, difficulty socializing with others, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, poor mentalizing (perspective taking), and poor verbal expression mirror characteristics of children with ASD (39, 41). Likewise, studies suggest that, when controlling for comorbid PTSD, individuals with DTD have higher rates of ADHD, social and separation anxiety disorders, panic disorders, severe mood and behavior disturbances, depression, and suicide (28, 183).\nChildren and adolescents with indications of DTD, such as those with multiple ACEs (i.e., polyvictimization), are more likely to display suicidal behaviors and make suicide attempts than individuals without early interpersonal traumas (16). Likewise, these children may have higher rates of school absenteeism and learning disorders due to DTD (184, 185). Children with DTD are affected across cognitive (e.g., learning, attention, and information processing), physiological (e.g., fight-or-flight, susceptibility to infections including from common colds and flu), emotional (e.g., depression and suicide, anger), and behavioral domains that span the continuum of internalizing and externalizing disturbances. Behavioral displays (or traumatic reenactments) that signal fear, emotional dysregulation, and vulnerability interfere with children's academic achievement, self-efficacy, and classroom behaviors.\nWhen individuals with DTD move into young adulthood, they may struggle to manage independently and experience difficulty adjusting to new settings. If they attend college or university, they may find it hard to self-regulate and map out the steps needed to complete assignments and tasks successfully. They may question the value of education, learning, or effort, given persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and existential despair. Some may drop out of school, experience inconsistent employment, or hold employment positions that are not satisfying (167, 186), likely because their vocational identity development was interrupted by chronic depression and anxiety (16, 187, 188) resulting from reoccurring abuse and neglect. Their lack of confidence and low self-esteem, along with high rates of addiction (189–191), can also lead to further increased anxiety, anger and hostility, and job instability (192, 193). They may feel worried about re-traumatization or being stigmatized because of their challenges. As a result, some will choose not to disclose personal information to others who might help them, believing that the vulnerability could put them at a disadvantage for recruitment or advancement.\nClinicians and care supporters working with individuals who have experienced significant childhood trauma should be aware that DTD symptoms differ depending on the specific traumas experienced, the characteristics of the individuals involved, and the level of discordance between the individuals and their environments. Symptoms will also vary depending on each individual's degree of environmental support, perceived controllability of the stressful events, access to socioeconomic resources, and effective evaluations and treatments (194). Medical problems and somatic complaints may actually be the result of childhood trauma and a sign of DTD. In fact, a number of chronic, non-specific, or unexplained medical illnesses are associated with DTD (13, 56). In addition, lowered immunity, cardiac symptoms, and neurological disorders such as migraines and chronic fatigue are also signs to look for in patients who could potentially have DTD (195).\nClinicians working with early trauma survivors should also consider relational patterns corresponding to substantive behavioral changes, particularly personality disturbances. Individuals exposed to severe abuse, neglect, and violence may go on to develop long-lasting negative schemas about themselves and the world, including deep feelings of inferiority, fear, self-hatred, and distrust, all of which can give rise to maladaptive personality styles and, in some cases, clinically significant characterological disturbances (196). As adults, individuals with DTD may develop a broad range of personality and emotional disorders (60, 68, 197), which are associated with high rates of emergency room visits and inpatient hospitalizations (17, 198).\nEmpirically validated treatments for children and adolescents with DTD are limited in scope. However, there is growing evidence for integrative treatment approaches and relationally focused\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DTD<|>EVENT<|>Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD) is a condition that arises from significant childhood trauma, leading to various psychological and behavioral issues in affected individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADHD<|>EVENT<|>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which may co-occur with DTD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASD<|>EVENT<|>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that can exhibit symptoms similar to those of DTD, such as emotional numbing and difficulty socializing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Children and adolescents are the primary demographic affected by DTD, displaying various clinical signs and symptoms related to trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>Young adults who have experienced DTD may struggle with independence and adjusting to new settings due to their traumatic past.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>PERSON<|>Clinicians are professionals who work with individuals affected by DTD, providing evaluations and treatments tailored to their needs.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>DTD<|>Children are the primary group diagnosed with DTD, showing symptoms related to their traumatic experiences<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>DTD<|>Young adults may continue to experience symptoms of DTD as they transition into adulthood, affecting their independence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>DTD<|>Clinicians provide treatment and support for individuals diagnosed with DTD, addressing their unique symptoms and needs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>ADHD<|>Children with DTD may also be diagnosed with ADHD, as symptoms can overlap<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>ASD<|>Children with DTD may be misdiagnosed with ASD due to overlapping symptoms<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>ADHD<|>Young adults with DTD may also struggle with ADHD symptoms, impacting their daily functioning<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>ASD<|>Young adults with DTD may exhibit traits similar to those seen in ASD, complicating their diagnosis<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
