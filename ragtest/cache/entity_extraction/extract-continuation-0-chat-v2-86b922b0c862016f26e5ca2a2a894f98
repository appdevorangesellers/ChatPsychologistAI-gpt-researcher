The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher in patients with acute or chronic medical or mental health disorders. Sleep disorders are under-recognized problems. Sleep disorders are associated with impaired mental health and physical health, as well as a reduced quality of life. Various negative daytime consequences include sleepiness, depressed mood, social isolation and decreased productivity. Patients usually seek professional help because of daytime symptoms and/or dysfunction. Treatment potentially alleviates or reduces negative daytime symptoms and improves quality of life, although more research is clearly desirable in this area. Specific clinical subpopulations suffering from sleep disorders should be identified for more targeted interventions.\nExpert Review of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research Sleep Disorders: Impact on Daytime Functioning and Quality of Life András Szentkirályi, MD; Csilla Z Madarász, MD; Márta Novák, MD, PhD Disclosures Expert Rev Pharmacoeconomics Outcomes Res. 2009;9(1):49-64. In This Article Abstract and Introduction Insomnia Restless Legs Syndrome Obstructive Sleep Apnea Shiftwork Conclusion Expert Commentary Five-year View References Sidebar: Key Issues Abstract and Introduction Abstract This article provides an overview of the daytime symptoms associated with the most common sleep disorders, namely insomnia, restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and shift wake-sleep disorder. Psychological and social dysfunction resulting from these sleep disturbances are explained and discussed in detail. Health-related quality of life is a concept that reflects the changes in diverse aspects of subjective wellbeing of the patients due to an illness. Therefore, studies reporting quality-of-life issues associated with the aforementioned sleep disorders will also be presented. Finally, we review the limited data regarding the effects of treatment on quality-of-life outcomes. Introduction Many patients with sleep disorders seek medical attention because of daytime symptoms or negative consequences of sleep disruption, which suggests that the night-time symptoms may be less bothersome than the daytime consequences of sleep problems.
