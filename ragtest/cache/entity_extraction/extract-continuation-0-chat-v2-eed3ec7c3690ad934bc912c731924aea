It encompasses strategies to amplify, maintain, or decrease one’s emotional responses. It involves a range of strategies, from cognitive reappraisal to mindfulness practices, that help individuals cope with difficult situations and have emotional control. Effective emotion regulation has been linked to a range of positive outcomes, including improved well-being, better interpersonal relationships, and enhanced resilience in the face of stress and adversity. Being able to regulate emotions is a skill, meaning that people often learn emotional regulation as they grow up. Some people may find it easier than others to regulate their emotions. Emotional regulation reflects a set of processes that influence: Which emotions someone has When they have these emotions How they experience and express these emotions Emotional regulation is not to be confused with eliminating or controlling emotions but with moderating the experience of the emotions being experienced. This includes the ability to alter the intensity or duration of an emotion rather than changing it completely. Being able to moderate the intensity of the emotion can help to control behavior and emotional reactions. When an emotion is felt, for example, anger, this can be triggered when feeling threatened or powerless. Why is emotional regulation important? Being able to regulate emotions is important since our emotions are closely connected to how we think and feel. Our thoughts and feelings help us to decide how best to respond to a situation and what action we should take. Essentially, emotional regulation can influence behavior. Learning skills to regulate our emotions means that, instead of acting impulsively and doing something that may be regretted later, we are able to make thought-out choices. This can mean that we can learn to manage relationships with others, problem-solve, and have better control over our mental health. If our emotions are shut down or avoided, we may struggle with powerlessness, negative thinking, ruminating, resentment, and increased frustration. This could result in the development of anxiety, depression, or physical complaints. Examples of common emotion regulation strategies Below are some of the common healthy and unhealthy emotion regulation strategies that people use: Healthy strategies These can include the following: Practicing meditation or mindfulness Engaging in therapy Talking through emotions with friends Develop emotional intelligence skills Writing in a journal Noticing when a break is needed – having some space from others Having good sleep hygiene Unhealthy strategies These can include the following: Self-injurious behaviors Alcohol and substance abuse Emotional eating Avoiding or withdrawing from difficult situations Excessive use of social media to the exclusion of other responsibilities Withdrawing from others – social isolation What is emotion dysregulation? Emotion dysregulation is the inability to use healthy strategies to diffuse or moderate negative emotions. It is common for people to occasionally use less-than-ideal emotional regulation strategies. However, individuals who regularly experience overwhelming, intense, negative emotions are much more likely to rely on unhealthy strategies. Imagine a scenario where one of your friends does not turn up for a pre-arranged lunch with you. Instead of considering the many reasonable explanations for why this happened, this event can trigger feelings of hurt or abandonment for someone with emotional dysregulation. They may feel intense anger or resentment, resulting in acting on these emotions, such as shouting at the friend, accusing them of being a bad friend, or withdrawing from the friendship. In a distressing situation, someone with inadequate emotion regulation skills experiences distress related to negative emotions and a lack of control over their emotions. When acting on our dysregulated emotions, we can end up behaving in ways that overwhelm us further, meaning we can get stuck in a vicious emotional cycle. Dysregulation lies on a spectrum between underregulated and overregulated styles. Both make it hard to self-soothe and return to baseline emotional states. Someone with dysregulated emotions may: Have reduced awareness and understanding of their emotions Have the inability to inhibit impulsive behaviors Have heightened, labile negative emotions Have a high sensitivity to emotions in a social context Some of the common behaviors of someone with emotion dysregulation include: Dissociating Numbing Rage Violent outbursts Impulsive, reckless behavior Substance abuse Avoidance Self-injurious behaviors What causes poor emotional regulation? Having poor emotional regulation often comes from childhood. Below are some possible causes for why someone may struggle with regulating their emotions: Temperament A temperament is mainly determined by genetic inheritance and is usually stable across time and situations. It may be possible that some children develop poor emotional regulation due to their temperament. Differences in temperament can be observable very early in life. Some infants are calm and even-tempered, while others tend to have more intense and longer stress reactions which may contribute to poorer emotional regulation. Trauma Trauma is described as the experience of catastrophic affect an individual cannot process, understand, and/or integrate. The overwhelming intensity of feelings can automatically freeze or shut down consciousness. Many people who experience trauma, especially as a child, are likely to have poor emotional regulation. Someone who experiences trauma may have inflexible strategies to help with emotions – often one way of reacting to negative emotions. The more trauma someone has experienced as a child, such as experiencing or witnessing abuse, the more likely they are to have severe emotional dysregulation. Attachment styles Early attachment experiences shape emotion regulation abilities. Infants need caregivers to help modulate their affects through attuned bonding. Without this, children fail to develop self-soothing capacities and instead rely on external regulation. Insecure attachment styles involve suboptimal parental attunement. Caregivers may be inconsistent, unavailable, extreme, or invalidating. Children internalize these dynamics, learning unhealthy regulation habits like suppression or dramatic emotionality.
