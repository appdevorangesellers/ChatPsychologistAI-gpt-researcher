A review and meta-analysis identified 13 trials that included 20,092 participants (Rahman, Fisher, and others 2013). In all these studies, the intervention was delivered by supervised, nonspecialist health and community workers; in many of the studies, the intervention was integrated into a primary care platform. Compared with routine care, the evidence suggests significant benefits for mothers and children from the interventions tested. The pooled effect size for maternal depression was 0.38 (95 percent CI: –0.56 to –0.21). Where assessed, the benefits to children included improved mother-infant interaction, better cognitive development, reduced diarrheal episodes, and increased rates of immunization.Cognitive Behavioral TherapyCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention used for the management of anxiety disorders in children. The components of CBT for children consist of cognitive interventions and behavioral strategies. The cognitive interventions teach children to recognize their anxious feelings and the somatic experiences that accompany anxiety (for example, breathlessness and palpitations), identify the anxious thoughts that are associated with the anxious feelings, develop alternative thoughts (for example, positive self-talk) and other coping strategies, and evaluate the differences in their emotions after using the coping strategies. The behavioral interventions include relaxation training, modeling behaviors, and graded exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli.A meta-analysis of 41 studies examined the effectiveness of CBT compared with waitlist control, treatment as usual, and other interventions (James and others 2013). Compared with waitlist controls, CBT had a large effect on reducing anxiety diagnoses and symptoms, with a standarized mean difference of –0.98 (95 percent CI: –1.21 to –0.74). However, these studies were conducted in outpatient clinics in HICs; none of the included studies were from LMICs.The evidence for the effectiveness of CBT in LMICs is very limited; two studies evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. In Zambia, local lay counselors delivered trauma-focused CBT to the families of 58 children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 18 years who had moderate to severe trauma symptoms. The intervention was provided to the families of the children and achieved significant reductions in the severity of trauma symptoms, as well as the feelings of shame. Although there was no control group, this study demonstrates the potential feasibility of delivering trauma-focused CBT in LMICs (Murray, Dorsey, and others 2013; Murray, Familiar, and others 2013).In a study in Brazil, clinical psychologists delivered 14 sessions of group-based CBT, with two concurrent parental sessions, to 28 children ages 10–13 years who were suffering from anxiety disorders. Twenty children (71 percent) completed the treatment; there was a reduction in symptoms, with a moderate to large effect size (Cohen’s d between 0.59 and 2.06), depending on the outcome measure used (De Souza and others 2013). These studies provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of CBT-based interventions for anxiety disorders in LMICs; however, further research is needed.Medications for ADHDPharmacotherapy has the strongest evidence for reducing behavioral problems and improving the attention and educational performance of children with ADHD (Benner-Davis and Heaton 2007; Greenhill and others 2002; Prasad and others 2013). The dispensing of stimulant medications is increasing in HICs (Hollingworth and others 2011; McCarthy and others 2012), but no studies have examined whether these trends exist in LMICs. The wide recognition in HICs of the problems of stimulant medication diversion and misuse has resulted in recommendations for increased monitoring and regulations (Kaye and Darke 2012). Therefore, although stimulant medications are very effective treatments for ADHD, the potential difficulties with obtaining comprehensive assessments of the children to ensure accurate diagnosis and the high likelihood of diversion and misuse in the absence of regulatory systems limit the feasibility of the widespread use of stimulant medications in LMICs.Specialist Health CareMedications for Conduct DisorderParenting interventions are the best treatments for younger children with disruptive behavioral disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. However, the use of pharmacotherapy can assist in the treatment of adolescents with conduct disorder. Recent evidence has suggested that the use of pharmacologic agents—in particular, second-generation antipsychotics—is increasing (Pringsheim and Gorman 2012) in children and adolescents with conduct disorder.Although the use of such agents is increasing, the evidence base is not necessarily strong. Reasonably strong evidence supports the use, particularly in the short term, of second-generation antipsychotics, especially risperidone, in young people with borderline intelligence quotients (IQs) (Duhig, Saha, and Scott 2013). However, the evidence in young people with a normal IQ is not strong. Other agents have also been evaluated in such children, including stimulants and lithium (Ipser and Stein 2007). Psychopharmacological therapy in young people with conduct disorder needs to be carefully monitored and only introduced within the setting of specialist care (Ipser and Stein 2007). Its routine use, particularly in LMICs, is not recommended.Psychosocial Treatments for Conduct DisorderPsychosocial treatments have been evaluated for children and adolescents with conduct disorder and other disruptive behaviors, including cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI), problem-solving skills therapy (PSST), and multisystem therapy.Cognitive behavioral intervention. The goal of CBI is to train children in altering their dysfunctional (aggressive) cognitive processes. Generally, such interventions have been found to be effective in children with disruptive behaviors, with effect sizes\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
