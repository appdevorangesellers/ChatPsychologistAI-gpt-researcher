The findings by Angelelli et al. and Hull et al. underline the importance of investigating and treating sleep apnea thoroughly, in order to improve daytime functioning, particularly in vulnerable populations.\nFocusing on a different sleep disorder, namely insomnia, the work by Bickly et al. proposes a new instrument to measure how this condition affects different types of daytime activities, such as work, care for children and physical exercise. The researchers show that while insomnia patients participate in most daytime activities, they report that it takes them more effort and that sleep affects their participation negatively [11], which warrants timely intervention for this chronic limiting condition.\nThe manuscripts by Kölbel et al., Bacaro et al. and Mughal et al. address different aspects of the vital topic of sleep problems in children. In young children from six months to three years, Bacaro et al. show that daytime naps and night-time sleep duration are lower than formal health guidelines suggest. These guidelines stipulate that period of time before falling asleep is inversely related to positive emotions, and that daytime naps play an important role in emotional regulation in toddlers [12]. Kölbel et al. show that different sleep disorders are prevalent in children and young adults suffering from sickle cell anemia (4–23 years of age), causing daytime sleepiness [13]. By comparing groups of 6-to-12-year olds with, and without, autism or fetal alcohol syndrome, Mughal et al. show that in all participants, cognitive performance was related to sleep quality, and that particularly those children with autism or fetal alcohol syndrome suffered from multiple sleep problems [14].\nIn summary, the importance of investigating daytime consequences of sleep problems is emphasized by a collection of excellent manuscripts highlighting different sleep disorders, how they affect daytime cognitive functioning and sleepiness, how they are affected in vulnerable populations and what pathophysiological mechanism underlie them. These reports warrant future research on the effects of sleep treatment on cognitive, affective and physical daytime functions, as well as global health.\nFundingThis research received no external funding.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesKillgore, W.D.S.
