The ways in which people and cultures represent and respond to past traumas become more central than an examination of the facts when we consider historical trauma as narrative. Understanding historical trauma as a public narrative thus reframes the discussion of historical trauma from a search for historical explanation towards recognition of the contemporary experience of historical trauma and the ways in which current public narratives impact health. A central problem for the scientific study of how the past influence present health is that past events are contestable, as outlined in our discussion on memory and historical narratives, and fundamentally distal to the more proximate factors that influence present health. Whitbeck, Adams, et al. (2004) provide guidance on how one might disentangle proximal versus distal causes when examining the effects of historical trauma. Since one cannot readily measure the impact of past events, sometimes centuries past, on present conditions, they propose examining historical trauma influences on current behavior through one’s psychological experience of historical loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Specifically, their research has demonstrated empirical links between thinking about historical loss and psychological health indicators, thus emphasizing how the public narrative of historical loss represents a contemporary stressor that has specific and measureable health implications. Defining Public Narratives Narratives are stories that string together events to construct meaning and establish discourse (Hinyard & Kreuter, 2007; Riessman, 1993). Through shaping past experience into coherent stories, narratives are the primary means by which people convey contemporary interpretations and aspirations (Bruner, 1991). In particular, people employ narratives to express both individual and collective identities (Wertsch, 2008) and to situate themselves in their social contexts (Hammack, 2008). Personal narratives are stories told by an individual and are unique to that person (Rappaport, 2000), such as a personal account of surviving a car accident. Public narratives differ from personal narratives in as much as they are expressed within public discourse (Ganz, 2011), are indicative of intersubjective understanding (O’Donnell & Tharp, 2012), and are common among a group of people (Rappaport, 2000). Public narratives, thus, are the stories that shape collective memory through reliance on narrative elements such as characters, actions, places, and time (Wertsch, 2008). For example, for one village in the Guinean Languette, the local public narrative recounting the collective memory of attacks by Sierra Leonean Liberation forces includes details regarding who perpetrated the attacks at what sites and when, as well as the armed resistance of village youth, and the period of struggle, poverty, and loss following the attacks (Abramowitz, 2005). We draw a distinction between personal and public by considering whether the story is uniquely told by an individual or whether it exists in a broader social and cultural discourse.Psychological Health and Public Narratives A substantial body of research shows a connection between different varieties of narratives and individual and community health. Individuals use narratives to understand traumatic experiences, and often report that they have changed negatively or positively in the aftermath of an experience (McAdams, Reynolds, Lewis, Patten, & Bowman, 2001; Tebes, Irish, Puglisi Vasquez, & Perkins, 2004). A common narrative recounts how one has been irrevocably injured or tainted by adversity (Degloma, 2009). For some, such an account yields a contamination narrative in which positive events are reinterpreted as leading to negative outcomes that result in decrements to well-being (McAdams et al., 2001). For example, the birth of a child may be interpreted as leading to increased stress and social isolation, especially when past trauma experiences are associated with related stressors. For others, the aftermath of trauma leads to a narrative of cognitive transformation or redemption in which a negative life experience is later viewed in positive terms, often after a period of personal struggle (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004). For example, one may see benefit in becoming more self-reliant after the death of a parent so as to result in a positive reinterpretation of the event’s aftermath, despite the pain caused by the loss. In contrast to contamination narratives, redemption and cognitive transformation narratives are positively associated with well-being and resilience (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004). Such personal narratives are contextualized within public narratives that inform how adversity is viewed within the broader culture or by a specific cultural group (Pals & McAdams, 2004). Public narratives may frame how post-traumatic growth, as one example, is even possible within a given socio-cultural context (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). Affiliation with group identity and knowledge of the narratives of that group can be a source of resilience for marginalized groups. For example, for indigenous youth and sexual minority youth, group affiliation can encourage a sense of participation in a political struggle evidencing collective strength (Wexler et al., 2009). Resilience in response to adversity and trauma is, in this way, a process in negotiation with influential public narratives such as those conveying group histories of trauma and survival. Just as individuals express resilience through narratives of transformation following traumatic events (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004), so too do groups and communities represent group resilience in narratives of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
