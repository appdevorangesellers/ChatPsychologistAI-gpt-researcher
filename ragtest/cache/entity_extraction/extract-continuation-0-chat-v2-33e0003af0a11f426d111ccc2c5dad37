Just as dominant cultural narratives serve as reminders of historical traumas, family and community narratives of resilience, action, and aspiration can provide a counter-weight to oppressive dominant cultural narratives (Rappaport & Simkins, 1991). Symbols of marginalization bring to life the traumas in historical trauma narratives (Evans-Campbell, 2008; Simms, 2008), whereas symbols of resistance and persistence bring to life messages of resilience and well-being (Denham, 2008; Fullilove, 1996).\nFinally, the figure also shows how narrative salience influences health impacts. Although Brave Heart (2003) emphasizes psychological distress as a common historical trauma response, as noted previously, other scholars have identified a range of negative health outcomes in response to historical trauma. For example, authors working with diverse populations throughout the world link historical traumas to such contemporary sequelae as predisposition to PTSD (Karenian et al., 2011; Kellermann, 2001b); symptoms of anxiety and depression, with a preponderance of shame and fear (Carolina Lopez, 2011; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Whitbeck et al., 2009); and disruptions to family and parent-child relationships (Bar-On et al., 1998; Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011). Similarly, numerous authors use historical trauma as an explanatory framework for understanding a wide-range of health disparities with psychological, social, and biological mechanisms (Crawford, 2013; Daley, 2006; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Sotero, 2006; Walters et al., 2011). Despite this range of potential health impacts, Gone (2013) emphasizes that the development of the notion of historical trauma originates out of the psychological literature, and therefore most discussions of historical trauma preference negative behavioral health impacts. Further, as summarized earlier, health impacts may exemplify wound and survival, trauma and resilience (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008).\nIllustrations of the Model\nNarratives of loss and resilience\nHistorical trauma narratives do not always offer a clear path to either wounding or resilience, but instead may indicate both of these responses simultaneously. For example, among many indigenous groups around the world, the history of being colonized forms a common narrative that includes being displaced from traditional land and resources, physically and culturally slaughtered, and portrayed by the dominant culture as uncivilized and less evolved (Duran, 2006). This narrative presents a history of trauma, including disease, warfare, colonization, cultural genocide, and poverty, yet it is also a story of ongoing resistance (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011)—it is a history of devastation and survival. Native American reservations in the U.S. and the coerced resettlement of Inuit into government towns in Canada serve as powerful examples of how historical trauma narratives can simultaneously manifest a sense of loss and resilience. This history carries a legacy of imprisonment—with reservations and government settlements serving as ongoing symbols of confinement and loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Conversely, these communities are also sites of resilience, where indigenous peoples maintain traditional family structures and provide rich enculturation (Walters, Simoni, & Evans-Campbell, 2002). Thus, reservations and government settlements serve a dual function—as reminders of loss as well as places that sustain cultural identity and continuity.\nA similar narrative of loss and resilience is found in Abramowitz’s (2005) description of how the public narratives of communities in the Guinean Languette after attacks on their villages resulted in varying post-traumatic symptoms. Those villages that created narratives of group trauma that stressed community persistence and the survival of cultural systems had lower rates of post-traumatic symptoms; in contrast, villages with public narratives that emphasized the destruction of the community’s local moral world exhibited higher post-conflict symptoms (Abramowitz, 2005). This example also illustrates two related observations about narratives of loss and resilience: 1) how the wide variation in public narratives about trauma may result in markedly varying health impacts, and 2) how varying health impacts may be observed despite common traumatic experiences.\nExamples of public narratives emblematic of loss and resilience are also evident in the experiences of other historically oppressed cultural groups, including descendants of the Armenian genocide during the Ottoman Empire, descendants of Stalinist persecution in Russian, African American, and aboriginal or indigenous peoples across the world. It is not uncommon for these narratives to include experiences of genocide, forced relocation, enslavement, and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; often alongside narratives of resistance, survival, hope, and resilience (Baker & Gippenreiter, 1998; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Fullilove, 2005; Karenian et al., 2011; Kienzler, 2008; Pollack, 2003; Wexler et al., 2009).\nHistorical trauma narratives response to disaster\nAlthough historical trauma has mostly been developed to explain the experiences of historically marginalized ethnic groups, the construct is also relevant to understanding individual and community health for groups who have experienced a natural disaster. As Cox and Perry (2011) note in describing how a large wildfire in British Columbia fundamentally altered the community psyche of the two towns most damaged by the fire, place-based traumas also engender public narratives that can impact health. Cox and Perry (2011) show how narratives portraying positive outcomes, such as strengthened sense of community, as well as negative ones, such as feelings of anxiety towards the stability and safety of place, were evident following this disaster. They also show how each of these narratives were related to people’s sense of place.
