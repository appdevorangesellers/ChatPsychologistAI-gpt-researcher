The DSM-5 Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group determined that autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, were not being applied consistently and correctly by clinicians. This inconsistency was obfuscating efforts to understand these disorders and to identify effective treatment interventions. The Work Group addressed this concern by using a dimensional approach to reclassifying these five maladies as a single diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder. A table provided in DSM-5 in the neurodevelopmental disorders chapter (Ref. 1, pp 34–6) provides examples of the different levels of severity. Specifiers for autism spectrum disorder include whether there is accompanying intellectual or language impairment or an association with a medical or genetic condition or environmental factor; with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder; or with catatonia. Thus, for example, in the absence of intellectual impairment, the DSM-5 diagnosis for a person with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Asperger's disorder is autism spectrum disorder without intellectual impairment and without structural language impairment. The decision to subsume Asperger's disorder as part of autism spectrum disorder has been controversial. Many clinicians, teachers, parents, and advocates fear that the change will stigmatize individuals with Asperger's disorder because autism historically has been thought of as a more severe disease.3,–,5 This concern has been particularly troubling in regard to high-functioning individuals with Asperger's disorder who have learned to adapt in the classroom, workplace, and elsewhere; some affected individuals have even managed to function without accommodations and without disclosing the diagnosis. Although Asperger's disorder is no longer a separate diagnosis, individuals and clinicians may continue to use the term in the interest of reducing the stigma and preserving the therapeutic alliance. Also, some have voiced concerns that removing the Asperger's disorder diagnosis from DSM-5 will cause affected individuals to lose eligibility for educational and other supportive services.6,7 However, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder are broader than the DSM-IV classifications for both autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder. The DSM-IV criteria required developmental delay or abnormal function to begin before the person's third birthday. However, in DSM-5, the symptom presentation for autism spectrum disorder must be evident during early development “but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life” (Ref. 1, p 50). The DSM-5 criteria capture the myriad clinical presentations of individuals within the autism spectrum. This consolidation may hinder the efforts of policy makers who use specific DSM-IV diagnoses (i.e., autistic disorder versus Asperger's disorder versus pervasive developmental disorder, NOS, to determine which individuals receive public support for rehabilitation and therapeutic services, e.g., education, therapy, health care, and housing). However, elimination of the artificial distinction may reduce the pressure that was encountered occasionally by clinicians to overdiagnose autistic disorder so that affected individuals could qualify for support services. A welcome addition to the DSM-5 autism spectrum disorder classification is the requirement for mental health professionals to individualize assessments by determining how therapeutic “intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask difficulties in at least some contexts” (Ref. 1, p 53). Although the clinical presentation may change, especially after effective therapeutic interventions, a child who has autism spectrum disorder continues to have that diagnosis as an adult “even if the symptoms are no longer present” (Ref. 1, p 54). These changes may enhance the thoroughness of forensic testimony or make it more challenging, since adults do not have to meet all diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder if, in the judgment of the evaluator, the disorder is present. Forensic experts may be expected to focus on capacity and impairment, rather than on exact diagnosis. The DSM-5 has lowered the threshold for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder by emphasizing the importance of adaptive functioning and clinical assessment. The revised diagnostic criteria may place a financial burden on agencies and organizations that are charged with the duty of distributing funds equitably to qualifying individuals. Only time will tell what the long-term outcome will be, but forensic psychiatrists may be consulted to review cases on behalf of agencies and individuals regarding eligibility for services and diagnostic updates. Forensic psychiatrists are asked to provide evaluations and testimony about capacity or competence, sentence mitigation, and rehabilitation needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Expert witnesses are now in a position to reinforce the fact that there are no clear lines of diagnostic distinction between DSM-IV autistic disorder and related disorders. An evaluation of an individual with autism spectrum disorder should include a determination of whether or which support services are needed to reduce the individual's impairment by improving his adaptive functioning. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder The increasing prevalence of the diagnosis of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) has received significant media attention because of concerns about overdiagnosis and overprescribing of stimulants.8,–,13 The competitive advantage in academics and athletics that stimulant use may afford individuals who do not have AD/HD is also troubling.14,–,16 Recreational use of stimulants (Ref. 17 and APA, unpublished manuscript, 2011) may contribute to addictive disorders, life-threatening health problems, and legal problems.15,16 Despite these concerns, the changes in the DSM-5 criteria for AD/HD have lowered the threshold for making the diagnosis in individuals who are older than 17 years, in whom the prevalence is 2.5 percent (Ref. 1, p 61). For diagnosis of AD/HD in adults, DSM-5 has reduced the minimum number of inattention symptoms from six to five and the age of symptom onset from before 7 years to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association that provides standardized criteria for the classification of mental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a diagnosis that encompasses various conditions previously classified separately, such as autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder, and is characterized by challenges in social skills, repetitive behaviors, and communication.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPBERGER'S DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Asperger's Disorder was previously classified as a separate diagnosis but is now included under Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5, often associated with high-functioning individuals.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a mental health condition characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which has seen increased prevalence and concerns regarding overdiagnosis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>PERSON<|>Forensic psychiatrists are mental health professionals who evaluate individuals for legal purposes, providing testimony and assessments regarding mental health conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and AD/HD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>PERSON<|>Clinicians are healthcare professionals who diagnose and treat mental health disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and AD/HD, and may face challenges in applying diagnostic criteria consistently.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 provides the diagnostic criteria and classification for Autism Spectrum Disorder, consolidating various previously separate diagnoses into one category<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 outlines the diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, including changes that lower the threshold for diagnosis<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>ASPBERGER'S DISORDER<|>Asperger's Disorder is now classified under Autism Spectrum Disorder in the DSM-5, indicating a relationship between the two diagnoses<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>Forensic psychiatrists evaluate individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder for legal purposes, providing assessments and testimony<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>Forensic psychiatrists also evaluate individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder for legal purposes, providing assessments and testimony<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>Clinicians diagnose and treat Autism Spectrum Disorder, facing challenges in applying the DSM-5 criteria consistently<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICIANS<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>Clinicians diagnose and treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, addressing concerns about overdiagnosis and treatment<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
