Explore Additional Income Streams\nConsider opportunities for supplemental income through part-time work, freelancing, or side hustles to help you reach your financial goals faster. Fortunately, there are many ways to make money today that are not tied to an hourly wage. Do what you can with what you have. However, be mindful not to work so hard that you are no longer able to tend to your mental, physical, emotional, or spiritual needs.\n12. Practice Self-Care\nPrioritizing self-care activities such as exercise, adequate sleep, and healthy eating can help maintain physical and mental well-being during stressful times. This can also make it easier to focus on problem-solving, rather than spending precious time and energy on stress and worry.\n13. Avoid Impulse Purchases\nIn today’s capitalistic society, many of us are addicted to the idea that things can buy happiness. However, it’s important to remember that consumerist culture is not designed to fuel our mental well-being. Rather, it’s perpetuated for the benefit of the person who stands to make money. Resist the temptation to make impulse purchases by implementing a cooling-off period before buying non-essential items. This can help you further reflect on why you really want or need an item before you buy it.\n14. Review and Adjust Goals\nMuch like our mental health, our finances make up an entire ecosystem. Things are constantly changing and evolving. Therefore, making it a priority to regularly review your financial goals and adjust them as needed to stay on track of your goals.\n15. Seek Professional Help\nConsult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized financial plan tailored to your goals and circumstances. There are also certain nonprofit organizations that offer these kinds of services for free, so make sure to check out 211, a free helpline available in all 50 states that connects inquirers with resources in their area.\n16. Explore Government Assistance Programs\nIn addition to 211, you can also check with your local social services to investigate any potential eligibility for government assistance programs. This can be anything from unemployment benefits and housing assistance to food stamps and healthcare.\n17. Practice Gratitude\nIt may sound silly, but cultivating an attitude of gratitude can really help you to focus on the positive aspects of your life while acknowledging small victories on your financial journey. Also, by focusing on what we have rather than what we lack, we can help calm our anxious minds that may be going into panic mode over financial stress and insecurity.\n18. Take Breaks from Financial Stress\nWhile it’s important to make time to think about and plan for your financial wellness, scheduling regular breaks to disengage from financial topics can help you recharge your mental and emotional batteries. There’s nothing wrong with putting the pause button on while you take some time to focus on other aspects of your mental well-being.\n19. Develop Coping Strategies\nIdentify healthy coping mechanisms, such as journaling, creative expression, or spending time in nature, to manage stress and anxiety more effectively. This can help you move through challenging moments with greater ease and awareness.\n20. Consider Therapy\nFinally, it’s important to consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance for managing financial stress if it’s impacting your mental health.\nHow Therapists Can Help\nWhile therapists are not financial professionals, they can help coach you through a variety of problems you’re experiencing while offering helpful tools to improve your mental, physical, and emotional health. Therapists play a crucial role in supporting individuals experiencing financial stress, including the ways listed below.\nTherapists offer a safe and nonjudgmental space for clients to express their feelings of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty related to their financial situation.\nCognitive Behavioral Techniques\nTherapists employ cognitive-behavioral techniques to help clients identify and challenge negative thought patterns and beliefs about money, promoting healthier attitudes and behaviors.\nStress Management Skills\nTherapists teach clients relaxation tools, stress management strategies, and mindfulness exercises to reduce the physiological and psychological effects of financial stress.\nTherapists assist clients in developing practical problem-solving skills and coping strategies to address financial challenges effectively and regain a sense of control.\nSome therapists even specialize in financial therapy, which integrates traditional therapeutic approaches with financial counseling to address the intersection of money and emotions in clients’ lives.\nFinding Freedom From Financial Stress\nFinancial stress can take a significant toll on your mental, emotional, and physical health, but it’s essential to remember there are strategies and resources to help manage and alleviate this burden. By implementing practical coping strategies, seeking support from loved ones, and considering therapy when needed, individuals can navigate financial challenges with resilience and determination.\nReaching out to a therapist is not a sign of weakness but a proactive step towards improving your mental health and overall quality of life. If you’re struggling with financial stress, don’t hesitate to contact a therapist today for support and guidance on your journey to financial well-being. It’s important to know that this is a common issue. You are not alone and you don’t have to fix this alone either.\nNext Steps: Therapy at Plus by APN\nPlus by APN serves over 2,000 clients through therapy services alone.
