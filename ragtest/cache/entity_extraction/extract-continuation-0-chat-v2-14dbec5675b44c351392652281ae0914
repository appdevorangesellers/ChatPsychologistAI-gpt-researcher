Numerous studies indicate that traumatic experiences can lead to alterations in brain structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. These changes impair crucial functions, including emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and decision-making processes. Adults with a history of trauma may frequently exhibit heightened emotional reactivity, increased impulsivity, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining stable relationships. This emotional dysregulation often manifests as mood swings, anxiety, and depression, complicating interpersonal interactions and self-perception.\nThe inability to regulate emotions effectively is one of the hallmark challenges faced by individuals who have experienced early trauma.
