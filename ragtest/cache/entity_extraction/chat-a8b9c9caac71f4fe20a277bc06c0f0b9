Similarly, we follow this methodology in our study to\nconstruct a categorical variable where 3 = flourishing (score\nin the top tertile of the Keyes scale); 2 = moderate or sta-\nble (score in the middle tertile of the Keyes scale); 1 = lan-\nguishing (score in the bottom tertile of the Keyes scale). We\nalso use the composite scale in the secondary analysis of this\nstudy to examine changes in the scale over time.\nIndependent Variables. The\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n7\n0\nindependent variables for this\nstudy are grouped into three major categories—financial\nsituation and perceived abilities, health, educational attain-\nment, sociodemographic, and social engagement-related\nfactors. These variables are described below:\nFinancial Situation and Perceived Ability.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n7\n5\nfinan-\ncial situation variables included continuous variables for\nincome, family wealth, student loan debt, and credit card\ndebt. Log values of these variables were included in the\nempirical models estimated in this study. The perceived\nabilities variables were perceived responsibility (7-point\nLikert-type scale: 1 = not at all well; 7 = extremely well),\nproblem-solving ability (1 = not at all well; 7 = extremely\nwell); ability to pay off credit card debt (1 = not at all well;\n7 = extremely well); and the ability to manage money (1 =\nnot at all well; 7 = extremely well).\nHealth.\nFor\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n8\n0\nperceived health status, those respondents\nwho reported being in excellent health were coded as 1 and\n0 if otherwise.\nSociodemographic Factors.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n8\n5\nsociodemographic vari-\nables include demographic factors related to education, age,\ngender, race, and ethnicity. Educational attainment variables\nPdf_Folio:190\n190\nJournal of Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 32, Number 2, 2021\n\ncomprise four binary variables: graduated from college (1 =\nyes; 0 = otherwise); currently in college (1 = yes; 0 = oth-\nerwise); dropped out of college (1 = yes; 0 = otherwise);\nand never attended college (1 = yes; 0 = otherwise). In the\nempirical models used in this study, the currently in col-\nlege variable has been used as the reference group, and the\nother educational attainment variables have been compared\nagainst this variable. Age is included as a continuous vari-\nable, and gender is coded as female (1 = yes; 0 = male). Four\nbinary variables for race/ethnicity included in this study are\nnon-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, and other races. In the\nempirical analyses, the non-Hispanic White category was\nused as the reference group.\nAmong\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n9\n0\nthe parental influence-related variables, mother and\nfather’s number of years of education were included in\nthe model. The PSID-TA dataset also includes information\non the emotional closeness of respondents to their parents.\nCloseness to father (1 = least close; 7 = very close) and\ncloseness to mother (1 = least close; 7 = very close) were\nalso included as control variables in this category.\nSocial Engagement.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n9\n5\nsocial interaction variables\nincluded five binary variables based on whether the respon-\ndents participated in social activities while in school or\ncollege. These binary variables included participation in\nvolunteering activities, social activism; school clubs; art,\nmusic, or theater performances; and sports. These variables\nwere coded as binary (1 = yes; 0 = otherwise).\nAnalyses\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n0\n0\ndescriptive statistics of the dataset, along with a table of\ncorrelation of mental flourishing with financial situation and\nperceived abilities-related factors, are presented in Tables 1\nand 2. In this study, the first dependent variableYit is cate-\ngorical (1 = languishing; 2 = moderate (base); 3 = flourish-\ning), and the second dependent variable is continuous. The\ndata comprised a panel constructed from three consecutive\nwaves (2009, 2011, and 2013) of the PSID and its TA sup-\nplements.
