Consistent with previous research\nPdf_Folio:195\nJournal of Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 32, Number 2, 2021\n195\n\n(Low, 2011), engagement in social activities was associated\nwith both flourishing and languishing states of young adults.\nThese findings were consistent with those from previous\nstudies, which found that participation and engagement in\nsocial and community events had a positive association with\nmental health and a negative association with depression\nor mental languishing (Keyes, 2007; Low, 2011; Ottenrit-\nter, 2004). Providing opportunities to participate in various\nsocial activities might be important to the mental health of\nyoung adults.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nGiven\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n3\n0\n5\nthe limitations of the dataset and the young age of\nthe respondents, detailed information on the effect of finan-\ncial asset holdings on the mental health continuum was not\nincluded in the analyses. However, future studies are needed\nto examine the role of financial asset holdings of the respon-\ndents in the model. Although this study used panel data and\nexamined respondents across time, more studies are needed\nto establish causality between flourishing and the covariates\nthat were found to be significantly associated with flourish-\ning in this study. The mental health and functioning of young\nadults is an issue of universal interest. Future studies exam-\nining the predictors of flourishing among young adults in\nother countries should be encouraged. It will be important\nto examine the enduring factors that remain associated with\nflourishing as these young adults grow older and reach the\nasset accumulation phase of their life cycle.\nImplications\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n3\n1\n0\nfindings from the current study show that perceived\nfinancial capability is positively associated with mentally\nflourishing and negatively associated with mentally lan-\nguishing. Additional research is needed to see the long-term\neffects of financial capability on mental health. This rela-\ntionship could also be bi-directional; that is, mental health\nstates could influence perceived confidence in peoples’\nfinancial capability and financial well-being, as languishing\nhas been found to be negatively associated with productiv-\nity and psychosocial functioning in a previous study (Keyes,\n2007).\nIn\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n3\n1\n5\nlight of the growing concerns about the financial debts of\nyoung people, the findings suggest that the ability to man-\nage consumer debt such as credit cards and student loans\nis important and that a better ability to manage debt may\nbe beneficial for the mental health and well-being of young\nadults. Financial and mental health counselors need to be\naware of this relationship and make appropriate referrals for\nyoung adults as needed. Financial educators and counselors,\nwhen counseling young adults with debt burdens, may need\nto help their clients realize the negative financial conse-\nquences of debts such as delinquency, bankruptcies, and\ndecreased net worth for their mental health and well-being.\nFurthermore, they can coach young people in improving\ntheir financial management skills and abilities to understand\nthe lifelong impacts of borrowing and make informed deci-\nsions in borrowing. More targeted education and counseling\nmay be needed for those young people who exhibit signs of\noverborrowing or potential debt problems. Financial educa-\ntion programs have been found to improve financial man-\nagement skills and confidence (Fernandes et al., 2014). Such\nfinancial education and counseling can be used as an inter-\nvention, especially for moderately mentally healthy people.\nUnderstanding and promoting the well-being and mental\nflourishing of young adults may be as important as address-\ning mental illness.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n3\n2\n0\nfinding that participation in social activities was neg-\natively associated with languishing underscores the impor-\ntance of promoting greater opportunities for group-oriented\nactivities across neighborhoods, as this can improve both\nsocial capital and sense of well-being among young\nadults. Schools should also emphasize similar activities\nthat encourage student participation. A related recent study\nfound experiential learning to be an effective method of\nfinancial socialization of children (LeBaron et al., 2019).\nFinancial education programs based on experiential learn-\ning, such as peer financial education or providing educa-\ntion and mentoring opportunities in the community, could\nbenefit young adults. By engaging in their own behaviors\nand others’, young adults may increase their participation in\nsocial activities as well as improve their own financial capa-\nbility, both of which will lead to improved mental health. It\nis suggested that policies should address the financial and\nmental health of young adults, such as the inclusion of health\nand financial clinics on college campuses. Young adults who\nare not currently in college need opportunities to improve\nsocial engagement and financial capabilities at a low or min-\nimal cost.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n3\n2\n5\nfindings from this study indicate that while endow-\nment factors such as family wealth, closeness to mother,\nand health are positively associated with a flourishing\nPdf_Folio:196\n196\nJournal of Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 32, Number 2, 2021\n\nstate of mind in young adults, perception of one’s abil-\nity or self-efficacy-related factors, such as the percep-\ntion of being financially responsible, confidence in one\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication that discusses financial counseling and planning, focusing on the mental health and financial capabilities of young adults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals in the age group typically considered to be between 18 and 30 years old, who are the focus of the study regarding mental health and financial capability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL CAPABILITY<|>EVENT<|>The ability to manage financial resources effectively, which is positively associated with mental health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>EVENT<|>The psychological state of individuals, which can be influenced by financial capability and social engagement.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL ACTIVITIES<|>EVENT<|>Engagement in community and social events that can improve mental health and reduce feelings of languishing among young adults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS<|>EVENT<|>Programs designed to improve financial management skills and confidence among young adults, which can positively impact their mental health.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>FINANCIAL CAPABILITY<|>Young adults' financial capability is positively associated with their mental health and well-being<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>The mental health of young adults is influenced by their financial capability and social engagement<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIAL ACTIVITIES<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>Participation in social activities is negatively associated with mental languishing, thus improving mental health<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>Financial education programs aim to improve the financial management skills of young adults, which can enhance their mental health<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL CAPABILITY<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>Financial capability is linked to mental health, with better management of finances leading to improved mental states<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
