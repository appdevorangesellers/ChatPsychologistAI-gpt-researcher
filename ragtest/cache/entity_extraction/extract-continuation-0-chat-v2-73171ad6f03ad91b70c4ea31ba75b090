This categorization presents a\nbroader paradigm of mental health beyond the more con-\nventionally accepted states of mental disorder or absence of\nmental disorder (Keyes, 2002, 2006).\nStudies\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n2\n0\nshow that those flourishing are more adaptive\nto challenges than non-flourishers (Bergsma et al., 2011;\nDiener & Seligman, 2004; Huppert, 2009; Kobau et al.,\nPdf_Folio:188\n188\nJournal of Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 32, Number 2, 2021\n\n2011). Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)\nChild Development Supplement (CDS), Keyes (2002)\nfound that 40% of young respondents were flourishing, 6%\nwere languishing, and the rest were moderately mentally\nhealthy. Flourishing describes the level at which life expe-\nriences have gone well for individuals (Diener et al., 2010;\nHenderson et al., 2014; Keyes, 2002; Seligman, 2011).\nFlourishing encompasses the emotional, psychological, and\nsocial well-being of individuals (Keyes, 2002). Flourishing\nindividuals engage in adaptive coping strategies and exhibit\ninnovative and flexible behavior, while depressed or lan-\nguishing individuals engage in more maladaptive coping\nstrategies (Faulk et al., 2013; Fredrickson & Losada, 2005).\nBased\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n2\n5\non the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions,\nFaulk et al. (2013) suggested that positive emotions could\nexpand the coping strategies and decision-making abilities\nof young adults. Fredrickson and Losada (2005) suggested\nthat individuals, who experienced at least 2.9 positive emo-\ntions for every negative emotion (3:1 for practical purposes),\nwere more likely to flourish (Faulk et al., 2013). How-\never, limited information is available about the impact of\ndebt burden on positive psychology or positive mental well-\nbeing of young adults.\nFactors of Languishing and Flourishing\nBased\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n3\n0\non Keyes’ (2002, 2003) mental health continuum,\nan individual’s mental health may be associated with other\nsocial, psychological, or cognitive-functioning-related fac-\ntors (Garmezy, 1993; Luthar, 1991; Werner, 2000). Finan-\ncial situation variables such as debt burden, income, and\nwealth have been associated with the mental health of young\nadults (Cooke et al., 2004; Sweet et al., 2013; Tay et al.,\n2017; Walsemann et al., 2015). Studies by Cooke et al.\n(2004) and Sweet et al. (2013) found debt burden to be\nnegatively associated with mental health outcomes, stud-\nies by Tay et al. (2017) and Walsemann et al. (2015) found\nthat family resources, problem-solving abilities, and income\nmoderated the association between debt and subjective well-\nbeing of individuals.\nSociodemographic\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n3\n5\nvariables such as education, age, gen-\nder, and race have been associated with children’s mental\nhealth and resiliency (Keyes, 2002; Schotanus-Dijkstra et\nal., 2016). Educational attainment was positively associated\nwith flourishing mentally and had higher perceived well-\nbeing (Keyes, 2002; Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2016). Also,\nyoung adults were more likely to flourish mentally when\ncompared with older adults (Keyes, 2002). Women were\nfound to have more extreme emotional responses to both\npositive and negative situations (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al.,\n2016). Whites were positively associated with flourishing\nmentally, and conversely, were negatively associated with\nlanguishing (Keyes, 2002).\nIt\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n4\n0\nhas also been found that attributes such as having a sta-\nble family background and receiving affection and warmth\nfrom parents and caregivers are positively associated with\na flourishing mental state (Garmezy, 1993). Closeness to\nparents is another factor that reduces the risk of children’s\nnegative behavior (Werner, 2000). Additionally, parents’\neducational attainment (Luthar, 1991) and family financial\nsituation have also been associated with the financial well-\nbeing of young adults (Kim & Chatterjee, 2013).\nYoung\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n4\n5\nadults’ level of social engagement could also influ-\nence their mental health. Low (2011) found that civic\nand community engagement was positively correlated with\nflourishing among first-year college students. Positively\nperceived experiences from community engagement or\nservice-learning have been linked to reduced mental health\nissues such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety\n(Ottenritter, 2004). These positive experiences are included\nin the psychological and social dimensions of the Keyes\ncontinuum (Keyes, 2007; Low, 2011).\nThis\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n5\n0\narticle adds\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KEYES<|>PERSON<|>Keyes is a researcher who developed the mental health continuum model, which categorizes mental health states including flourishing and languishing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAULK<|>PERSON<|>Faulk is a researcher who suggested that positive emotions could expand coping strategies and decision-making abilities of young adults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOURISHING<|>EVENT<|>Flourishing describes a state of positive mental health where individuals experience well-being and adaptive coping strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Languishing<|>EVENT<|>Languishing is a state of mental health characterized by a lack of well-being and engagement in maladaptive coping strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal study that collects data on the economic, social, and health factors affecting families in the United States.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD DEVELOPMENT SUPPLEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Child Development Supplement (CDS) is a component of the PSID that focuses on the development of children in families.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>Young adults are individuals in the age group typically considered to be between 18 and 25 years old, whose mental health is influenced by various social and economic factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT<|>EVENT<|>Educational attainment refers to the highest level of education an individual has completed, which is positively associated with mental well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIVIC ENGAGEMENT<|>EVENT<|>Civic engagement involves participation in activities that promote the common good, which has been linked to improved mental health outcomes.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEYES<|>FLOURISHING<|>Keyes developed the concept of flourishing as part of his mental health continuum model<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAULK<|>FLOURISHING<|>Faulk's research suggests that positive emotions contribute to the state of flourishing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS<|>CHILD DEVELOPMENT SUPPLEMENT<|>The CDS is a part of the PSID that focuses on children's development<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>FLOURISHING<|>Young adults are more likely to experience flourishing compared to older adults<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT<|>Educational attainment is positively associated with the mental well-being of young adults<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>CIVIC ENGAGEMENT<|>Civic engagement is positively correlated with flourishing among young adults<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
