Early childhood experiences, such as neglect, abuse, or inconsistent caregiving, can disrupt the development of healthy emotional regulation skills. Chronic stress from family conflicts, financial instability, or exposure to violence may also contribute to difficulties in managing emotions.Biological factorsEmotional dysregulation may also be linked to biological factors, including neurochemical imbalances and brain function abnormalities. Neurotransmitters, which are chemicals in the brain that help transmit signals, can affect mood and emotions. If these chemicals are imbalanced, it may lead to problems with emotional regulation. Certain brain areas responsible for regulating emotions may also function differently in people with emotional dysregulation.Psychological factorsCo-occurring mental health conditions and certain personality traits can contribute to emotional dysregulation. For example, those of us with anxiety, depression, or borderline personality disorder (BPD) often struggle with regulating our emotions. Traits such as high sensitivity to stress or a tendency toward negative thinking can also make emotional regulation more challenging. 5 disorders related to emotional dysregulation1.
