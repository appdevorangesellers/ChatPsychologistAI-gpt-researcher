Resilience in response to adversity and trauma is, in this way, a process in negotiation with influential public narratives such as those conveying group histories of trauma and survival. Just as individuals express resilience through narratives of transformation following traumatic events (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004), so too do groups and communities represent group resilience in narratives of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008; Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) illustrates this effectively by tracing how narrative frames family identity and resilience strategies through four generations of an American Indian family. Family and public narratives, hence, influence the formation of personal narratives, the interpretation of one’s contexts, and the response to personal and collective traumas. Psychological well-being is related to one’s ability to process narratives and form coherent life stories and interpretations (Pals, 2006; Ville & Khlat, 2006). For example, the ability to develop autobiographical coherence linking one’s sense of self to the past and future, referred to as self-continuity, is predictive of suicide risk (Chandler, 1994). Like self-continuity, Chandler and Lalonde (2009) have shown how cultural-continuity—the degree to which a community engages in actions symbolic of their sense of community as a cultural group—functions as a protective factor and moderator of behavioral health problems among some indigenous Canadian communities. Historical trauma that results from colonization may lead to diminished cultural continuity, which may lead to limited collective action to preserve and advance a cultural legacy (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009). Conversely, narratives of continuity and cultural revitalization promote resiliency (Kirmayer, Dandeneau, Marshall, Phillips, & Williamson, 2011). Strong cultural identity may be emblematic of public resilience in the face of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013). For example, Taylor and Usborne (2010) argue that reconstruction of a strong cultural identity following collective trauma, such as war or disaster, is critical in subsequent individual and community well-being. Their research has shown that clarity in one’s cultural identity predicts personal well-being and that clarity in one’s self-concept mediates this relationship across diverse cultures (Usborne & Taylor, 2010). Furthermore, cultural identity represents the interaction between public norms and self-concept readily expressed in narratives (Gone, Miller, & Rappaport, 1999). International research demonstrates that, across many cultures, family and community narratives contextualize an intergenerational self-concept that serves an important protective role, such as for adolescents (Fivush, Habermas, Waters, & Zaman, 2011) or among marginalized groups who may face daily discrimination (Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) and Crawford (2013) both emphasize how for indigenous people in North America family narratives of historical trauma play a central role in how children situate themselves with respect to adversity and resilience.A Narrative Model for Understanding the Impact of Historical Trauma on Health Figure 1 presents a narrative model that specifies how public narratives of historical trauma impact health. As shown, the model specifies successive recursive stages beginning with public narratives of historical trauma that frame contemporary reminders of past collective trauma for a particular group or community. These contemporary reminders influence how salient the narrative is to a person or group; conversely, the salience of the narrative to the individual is critical in determining whether an experience will be interpreted as a reminder of historical trauma(s) or not. Narrative salience also influences whether the narrative will have health implications. Similarly, health status influences the salience of historical trauma narratives; for example, if a person struggles with health outcomes that are attributed to a public narrative of historical trauma, then that narrative is more likely to be seen as relevant to one’s life. Our narrative model of historical trauma is heuristic in that it emphasizes the possible recursive influences between historical trauma narratives, contemporary reminders of that trauma, narrative salience of the trauma within personal and public contexts, and health impacts. We provide a brief description of each component of the model below. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Narrative Model of How Historical Trauma Impacts Health: Public narratives connect historical traumas to health impacts through public and personal contemporary reminders and the degree of narrative salience. Each stage of the narrative model is recursively influential of the connecting stages.Historical Trauma Narratives The left side of Figure 1 depicts historical trauma narratives, that is, public narratives that are present-day, culturally-constructed accounts for a particular group. These narratives link the historical past through meaning-making to contemporary circumstances (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013) as depicted in subsequent stages in the model. Following from Wertsch (2008), these stories shape the collective memories of group traumas in the sense that they are stories collectively told, received, interpreted, and re-told—historical trauma narratives are the mechanisms by which memories of historical traumas are shaped and conveyed.Contemporary Reminders of Historical Trauma A strict definition of narrative requires a narrator telling the story; however, narratives as such are not the only mechanism by which information on historical traumas are communicated. For example, photography provides powerful visual representations that can serve as reminders of past atrocities (Sontag, 2003). Such contemporary reminders contextualize one’s lived-experience and interpretation of historical traumas. Research with children in Russia showed that situational reminders of trauma, such as walking past shelled buildings or encountering memorials at school, were found to be the greatest source of distress for the children (Scrimin et al., 2011). Similarly, Layne et al. (2010) identified general trauma reminders\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>An American Indian family that illustrates resilience strategies through narratives across four generations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>EVENT<|>Cultural continuity refers to the degree to which a community engages in actions that symbolize their sense of community as a cultural group, acting as a protective factor against behavioral health problems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma is the cumulative emotional and psychological wounds experienced by a group due to traumatic events in their history, such as colonization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>EVENT<|>Cultural identity represents the shared beliefs, values, and practices of a group, which can influence resilience in the face of historical trauma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>EVENT<|>A narrative model that specifies how public narratives of historical trauma impact health through various stages of influence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC NARRATIVES<|>EVENT<|>Public narratives are culturally-constructed accounts that link historical traumas to contemporary circumstances for a particular group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH IMPACTS<|>EVENT<|>Health impacts refer to the effects on individual and community health that arise from the interpretation of historical trauma narratives)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>The American Indian family exemplifies how cultural continuity can serve as a protective factor against behavioral health problems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>Historical trauma can diminish cultural continuity, affecting collective action to preserve cultural legacies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Cultural identity reconstruction is critical for individual and community well-being following historical trauma<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>PUBLIC NARRATIVES<|>The narrative model connects public narratives of historical trauma to health impacts through various stages<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTH IMPACTS<|>PUBLIC NARRATIVES<|>Health impacts are influenced by the salience of public narratives of historical trauma<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
