These children are more likely to experience a compromised developmental trajectory, with increased need for medical and disability services, as well as increased risk of contact with law enforcement agencies (Fergusson, Horwood, and Lynskey 1993).Childhood Mental and Behavioral DisordersThis chapter limits the discussion to the following five conditions: childhood anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, autism, and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive or inappropriate fear, with associated behavioral disturbances that impair functioning (APA 2013). Children with anxiety disorders have clinical symptoms, such as excessive anxiety; severe physiological anxiety symptoms; behavioral disturbances, such as avoidance of feared objects; and associated distress or impairment (Beesdo, Knappe, and Pine 2009).ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention and disorganization, with or\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WORLD BANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES G SCOTT<|>PERSON<|>James G.
