These findings\nare consistent with those of Heckman et al. (2014) study,\nwhich found debt to be positively associated with financial\nstress among college students. In another study, Lim et al.\n(2014) found that, among other factors, student loan debt\nwas a predictor of stress among students.\nInterestingly,\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n8\n0\nincome was negatively associated with being\nlanguishing, not flourishing, while family wealth was posi-\ntively associated only with flourishing. Both family wealth\nand income might affect young adults’ mental health signif-\nicantly but in different ways. Being financially responsible\nand having excellent health are positively associated with\nbeing flourishing but not languishing. These findings sug-\ngest that focusing only on negative mental health outcomes\nmay underestimate the effect of family wealth, being finan-\ncially responsible, and health on the positive end of the men-\ntal health continuum, or flourishing.\nSimilarly,\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n8\n5\nprevious studies have found using cross-sectional\ndata that financial debt was associated with poorer health\n(Fitch et al., 2011; Hoeve et al., 2014). However, debt has\nnot been studied previously in relation to the flourishing-\nlanguishing mental health continuum across time. In our\nstudy, credit card debt was associated with a decreased like-\nlihood of flourishing and increased likelihood of languish-\ning. These findings suggest that credit card debt burden\ncould decrease positive mental health, while young adults\nmay not exhibit the languishing or mental health disorder\nfrom credit card debt. Additionally, student loan debt in\nthe previous period was also associated with a decrease in\nflourishing over the current period. This negative associa-\ntion between student loan debt and flourishing is consistent\nwith findings from previous studies that found student loan\ndebt was negatively associated with life satisfaction across\ntime (Kim & Chatterjee, 2019) and was detrimental to young\nadults’ mental health (Walsemann et al., 2015). Similarly,\nin another study, Archuleta et al. (2013) found that student\nloan debt was associated with financial anxiety and distress.\nHowever, the overall negative effects of a financial bur-\nden on young adults’ well-being might not have been fully\nexplored. The negative effects on flourishing may decrease\noptimal human functioning (Seligman et al., 2005), which\nis a key asset for well-being and long-term social and eco-\nnomic prosperity (Barry, 2009). These findings add to the\nliterature by showing that both student loan debt and credit\ncard debt negatively affect the mental health of young adults\nacross time.\nThis\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n9\n0\nstudy found that those using adaptive coping strate-\ngies were more likely to be flourishing. On the other hand,\nindividuals who are languishing may benefit from par-\nticipation in social activities (Low, 2011) and improving\nperceived financial management capabilities. Perceived\nabilities such as being financially responsible, solving prob-\nlems, and managing money increased the likelihood of\nflourishing mentally significantly, while perceived ability in\nproblem-solving and money management were negatively\nassociated with languishing. These results are consistent\nwith previous studies that found problem-solving abilities\nand financial self-efficacy to be positively associated with\nthe psychological well-being of young adults (Garmezy et\nal., 1984; Heckman et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2014; Robb,\n2017). The present study also extends these findings to\nshow that, in addition to problem-solving abilities, task-\nspecific perceptions of individuals’ abilities such as the abil-\nity to manage money and the perception of being financially\nresponsible were associated with the psychological well-\nbeing of young adults.\nSimilarly,\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n9\n5\nBritt et al. (2016) found that financial knowl-\nedge was significantly associated with greater awareness\nof options, resulting in reduced anxiety while borrowing.\nPoor financial capability and debt have been linked to men-\ntal health problems such as depression and anxiety among\nyoung adults (Adams & Moore, 2007). Furthermore, this\nfinding related to the positive association between perceived\nabilities and flourishing/languishing in our study suggests\nthat interventions to improve people’s perceived abilities in\nmanaging money might contribute positively to their emo-\ntional, psychological, and social functioning.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n3\n0\n0\nnegative association between closeness to parents and\nlanguishing and the positive association between closeness\nto parents and flourishing were consistent with the find-\nings from previous studies that found a positive associa-\ntion between receiving better family and social support and\nthe physical and mental health of young adults (Schotanus-\nDijkstra et al., 2016).
