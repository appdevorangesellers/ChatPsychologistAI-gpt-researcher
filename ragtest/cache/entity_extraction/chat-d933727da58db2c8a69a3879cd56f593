Scott, The University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research, Queensland; Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Queensland, Australia;Email: ua.vog.dlq.htlaeh@ttocs.semaj.IntroductionChildhood mental and developmental disorders encompass neurodevelopmental, emotional, and behavioral disorders that have broad and serious adverse impacts on psychological and social well-being. Children with these disorders require significant additional support from families and educational systems; the disorders frequently persist into adulthood (Nevo and Manassis 2009; Polanczyk and Rohde 2007; Shaw and others 2012). These children are more likely to experience a compromised developmental trajectory, with increased need for medical and disability services, as well as increased risk of contact with law enforcement agencies (Fergusson, Horwood, and Lynskey 1993).Childhood Mental and Behavioral DisordersThis chapter limits the discussion to the following five conditions: childhood anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, autism, and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive or inappropriate fear, with associated behavioral disturbances that impair functioning (APA 2013). Children with anxiety disorders have clinical symptoms, such as excessive anxiety; severe physiological anxiety symptoms; behavioral disturbances, such as avoidance of feared objects; and associated distress or impairment (Beesdo, Knappe, and Pine 2009).ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention and disorganization, with or without hyperactivity-impulsivity, causing impairment of functioning (APA 2013). ADHD persists into adulthood in approximately 20 percent of individuals (Polanczyk and Rohde 2007).Conduct disorder diagnosed in children under the age of 18 years is characterized by a pattern of antisocial behaviors that violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms.Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe impairment in reciprocal social interactions and communication skills, as well as the presence of restricted and stereotypical behaviors.Intellectual disability is a generalized disorder that is characterized by significantly impaired cognitive functioning and deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors (APA 2013).Scope of the ChapterThis chapter reviews interventions to reduce the prevalence of childhood mental and developmental disorders through the prevention, reduction, or remission of symptoms. The effectiveness of selected interventions is evidence based; these interventions have the potential to be delivered in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The chapter does not discuss childhood depression, because of the overlap in interventions with adult depression.The chapter considers interventions in terms of delivery platforms rather than specific disorders. This choice is because of the very high comorbidity between childhood mental and developmental disorders (Bakare 2012; Rutter 2011). In addition, risk factors for childhood disorders are nonspecific and plurip\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
