DTD emerges from prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma that disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers and dramatically alters core assumptions and beliefs about one's vulnerability to danger in the world. DTD is theorized to develop from early interpersonal trauma. However, DTD may also result from the lack of a secure attachment relationship, which would have protected the developing individual during early trauma events. For example, a child who, within the context of a securely attached relationship with their caregiver, is exposed to abuse is likely to fare more positively than one who is exposed to the same abuse, yet lacks a secure attachment. The diagnosis of DTD was proposed for inclusion in the DSM-5 as an alternative to PTSD to better address the timing in which traumatic events occur (e.g., during sensitive periods of brain development) and the impacts on children's self-regulation skills and relational capacities (75). DTD attempts to provide this differentiation by underscoring experiences of pervasive, complex traumas that occurred early in life for children, and for adults whose physical, psychological, social and emotional disturbances originated from these experiences, which may be repeatedly interfering with their relationships, quality of life, self-identity, and life satisfaction. DT has been postulated to result in symptoms that extend beyond those of PTSD and that often occur when traumatized children and adolescents are exposed to developmental trauma(s). These symptoms may complicate or, in some cases, account for the mental health problems that lead to the diagnosis of several childhood/adolescent psychiatric disorders. This has been confirmed in a number of large-scale field trials, cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations, and comparative studies spanning diverse psychiatric groups (24, 31, 76, 77). It has been suggested that DTD is set apart from PTSD in that the former is precipitated by toxic stress, referring to prolonged activation of the stress response system, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in the absence of treatments and supportive peers and adults (78, 79). In addition, attachment disturbances associated with DTD originate at the beginning of an individual's lifespan development (e.g., parental neglect and abandonment, parents addicted to alcohol and drugs, separation from caregivers. By comparison, the causal events that lead to PTSD can occur at any point (or points) in one's life cycle. Investigations of individuals with DTD suggest that developmental trauma is often characterized by (1) poor self-identity development, (2) interpersonal sensitivity and consistent problems in relationships, including with peers, adults, and primary caregivers, (3) high rates of exposure to family and community violence, (4) high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, and (5) chronic and debilitating medical/neurological illnesses (24, 28, 34, 36, 80–82). Indeed, several studies have confirmed high comorbidities between PTSD and other disorders including depression, anxiety and panic/agoraphobia, psychotic disorders, and functional medical syndromes that might warrant differentiated assessment procedures and treatments (83–85). Studies of children living in pervasively abusive and neglectful circumstances indicate that children with characteristics of DTD commonly (often exclusively) rely on behavioral inhibition and cognitive dissociation; these responses are mediated by conditioned fear and physiological hypoarousal [i.e., the freezing adaptation of the stress response system; (86)]. Numerous studies suggest that individuals with complex traumas and DTD tend to cope with their traumas by deliberately evading reminders of the original trauma and by denying that such events occurred, including on self-report trauma symptom measures (87, 88), thereby conferring additive risks (i.e., dissociation and traumatic amnesia, undermining mental health needs). These traumatic stress adaptations, in turn, can contribute to experiences of emotional numbing and low frustration tolerance and precipitate behavioral outbursts that result in refractory (treatment-resistant) mood disturbances, long-term psychiatric hospitalizations (and re-hospitalizations), removal from school, and placement in foster care and juvenile justice treatment centers (89–93). The DSM-5 indicates that the sequelae of “prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., child abuse)” include symptoms that are consistent with DTD: “difficulties in regulating emotions or maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms” (p. 276). However, there is vigorous debate regarding the viability of this alternative designation, given that the criteria for other specified trauma and stress-related disorders are broad, lack specificity, include interpersonal and non-interpersonal antecedents, and require that providers first consider alternative-mainstream taxonomies. For example, DTD must be differentiated from PTSD, reactive and disinhibited attachment disturbances, and borderline personality disorder, the latter of which is marked by pervasive mood instability, impaired self-identity, dissociation, and provocative and confrontational interpersonal behaviors [often at extremes of the idealization and devaluation continuum; (60, 66, 68, 94)]. As such, several different approaches are used to diagnose persons who have experienced early, recurring stressors and are displaying indications of developmental trauma disorder.Developmental trauma: Diagnostic issues Researchers have developed objective procedures to diagnose children with indications of DTD (e.g., standardized interviews and psychometric instruments specifically designed to assess for trauma-mediated interpersonal and attachment disturbances). The Developmental Trauma Disorder - Semi-structured Interview (DTD-SI) is one such tool. DTD expert consensus guidelines and psychometric studies on the validity and reliability of the DTD criteria and the DTD-SI suggest that three factors differentiate DTD from other psychiatric disorders, including PTSD (24, 28, 34, 95, 96). These factors include emotion and physiological dysregulation (e.g., alex\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
