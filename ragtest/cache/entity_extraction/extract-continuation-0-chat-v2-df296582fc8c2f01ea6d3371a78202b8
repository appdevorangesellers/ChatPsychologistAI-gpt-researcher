These strategies can help you to break the cycle, ease the stress of money problems, and find stability again.\nTip 1: Talk to someone\nWhen you’re facing money problems, there’s often a strong temptation to bottle everything up and try to go it alone. Many of us even consider money a taboo subject, one not to be discussed with others. You may feel awkward about disclosing the amount you earn or spend, feel shame about any financial mistakes you’ve made, or embarrassed about not being able to provide for your family. But bottling things up will only make your financial stress worse. In the current economy, where many people are struggling through no fault of their own, you’ll likely find others are far more understanding of your problems.\n[Read: Social Support for Stress Relief]\nNot only is talking face-to-face with a trusted friend or loved one a proven means of stress relief, but speaking openly about your financial problems can also help you put things in perspective. Keeping money worries to yourself only amplifies them until they seem insurmountable. The simple act of expressing your problems to someone you trust can make them seem far less intimidating.\nThe person you talk to doesn’t have to be able to fix your problems or offer financial help.\nTo ease your burden, they just need to be willing to talk things out without judging or criticizing.\nBe honest about what you’re going through and the emotions you’re experiencing.\nTalking over your worries can help you make sense of what you’re facing and your friend or loved one may even be able to come up with solutions that you hadn’t thought of alone.\nGetting professional advice\nDepending on where you live, there are a number of organizations that offer free counseling on dealing with financial problems, whether it’s managing debt, creating and sticking to a budget, finding work, communicating with creditors, or claiming benefits or financial assistance. (See the “Get more help” section below for links).\nWhether or not you have a friend or loved one to talk to for emotional support, getting practical advice from an expert is always a good idea. Reaching out is not a sign of weakness and it doesn’t mean that you’ve somehow failed as a provider, parent, or spouse. It just means that you’re wise enough to recognize your financial situation is causing you stress and needs addressing.\nSpeak to a Licensed Therapist BetterHelp is an online therapy service that matches you to licensed, accredited therapists who can help with depression, anxiety, relationships, and more.

Take the assessment and get matched with a therapist in as little as 48 hours.\nOpening up to your family\nFinancial problems tend to impact the whole family and enlisting your loved ones’ support can be crucial in turning things around. Even if you take pride in being self-sufficient, keep your family up to date on your financial situation and how they can help you save money.\nLet them express their concerns. Your loved ones are probably worried—about both you and the financial stability of your family unit. Listen to their concerns and allow them to offer suggestions on how to resolve the financial problems you’re facing.\nMake time for (inexpensive) family fun. Set aside regular time where you can enjoy each other’s company, let off steam, and forget about your financial worries. Walking in the park, playing games, or exercising together doesn’t have to cost money but it can help ease stress and keep the whole family positive.\nTip 2: Take inventory of your finances\nIf you’re struggling to make ends meet, you may think you can ease your stress by leaving bills unopened, avoiding phone calls from creditors, or ignoring bank and credit card statements. But denying the reality of your situation will only make things worse in the long run. The first step to devising a plan to solve your money problems is to detail your income, debt, and spending over the course of at least one month.\nA number of websites and smartphone apps can help you keep track of your finances moving forward or you can work backwards by gathering receipts and examining bank and credit card statements. Obviously, some money difficulties are easier to solve than others, but by taking inventory of your finances you’ll have a much clearer idea of where you stand. And as daunting or painful as the process may seem, tracking your finances in detail can also help you start to regain a much-needed sense of control over your situation.\nInclude every source of income. In addition to any salary, include bonuses, benefits, alimony, child support, or any interest you receive.\nKeep track of ALL your spending. When you’re faced with a pile of past-due bills and mounting debt, buying a coffee on the way to work may seem like an irrelevant expense. But seemingly small expenses can mount up over time, so keep track of everything. Understanding exactly how you spend your money is key to budgeting and devising a plan to address your financial problems.\nList your debts. Include past-due bills, late fees, and list minimum payments due as well as any money you owe to family or friends.\nIdentify spending patterns and triggers. Does boredom or a stressful day at work cause you to head to the mall or start online shopping? When the kids are acting out, do you keep them quiet with expensive restaurant or takeout meals, rather than cooking at home? Once you’re aware of your triggers you can find healthier ways of coping with them than resort\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BETTERHELP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BetterHelp is an online therapy service that connects individuals with licensed therapists to help with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELPGUIDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HelpGuide is a user-supported organization that provides resources and information on mental health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>Family members are individuals related by blood or marriage who can provide emotional and financial support during difficult times.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDITORS<|>PERSON<|>Creditors are individuals or organizations to whom money is owed, often involved in financial discussions regarding debt management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS<|>EVENT<|>Financial problems refer to situations where individuals face difficulties in managing their finances, leading to stress and anxiety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>EVENT<|>Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, affecting how individuals think, feel, and act.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BETTERHELP<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>BetterHelp provides therapy services that address mental health issues, helping individuals cope with stress and anxiety<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HELPGUIDE<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>HelpGuide offers resources and information that support mental health and well-being<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAMILY<|>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS<|>Family members can provide support and assistance during financial problems, helping to alleviate stress<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREDITORS<|>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS<|>Creditors are involved in discussions regarding financial problems, as they are the parties to whom debts are owed<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>Financial problems can lead to increased stress and anxiety, impacting mental health<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
