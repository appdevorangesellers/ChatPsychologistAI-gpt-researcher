Explore Alumni Resources News Mental Health Challenges of Young Adults Illuminated in New Report Making Caring Common identifies several drivers of young adults’ emotional challenges, including a lack of meaning and purpose Posted October 24, 2023 By News editor Counseling and Mental Health Human Development Young adults in the U.S. report twice the rates of anxiety and depression as teens, according to a new report from Making Caring Common (MCC), a project of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The report identifies several drivers of young adults’ emotional challenges, including a lack of meaning and purpose.The report, On Edge: Understanding and Preventing Young Adults’ Mental Health Challenges, is based on a nationally representative survey of young adults (ages 18–25), teens, and parents conducted in December 2022. Thirty-six percent (36%) of young adults who responded to the survey reported anxiety compared to 18% of teens; 29% of young adults reported depression compared to 15% of teens.“Young adulthood can be a time of great growth and possibility,” said Richard Weissbourd, lead author of the report, faculty director of Making Caring Common, and senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “But far too many young adults told us that they feel on edge, lonely, directionless, and that they worry about financial security. Many are ‘achieving to achieve’ and find little meaning in either school or work.”The report identifies a variety of stressors that may be driving young adults’ high rates of anxiety and depression. The top drivers of young adults’ mental health challenges include:A lack of meaning, purpose, and direction: Nearly 3 in 5 young adults (58%) reported that they lacked “meaning or purpose” in their lives in the previous month. Half of young adults reported that their mental health was negatively influenced by “not knowing what to do with my life.”Financial worries and achievement pressure: More than half of young adults reported that financial worries (56%) and achievement pressure (51%) were negatively impacting their mental health.A perception that the world is unraveling: Forty-five percent (45%) of young adults reported that a general \"sense that things are falling apart” was impairing their mental health.Relationship deficits: Forty-four percent (44%) of young adults reported a sense of not mattering to others and 34% reported loneliness.Social and political issues: Forty-two percent (42%) reported the negative influence on their mental health of gun violence in schools, 34% cited climate change, and 30% cited worries that our political leaders are incompetent or corrupt.“Young adults’ mental health hasn’t been on our public radar in the way that teens’ mental health has been since the pandemic,” said Milena Batanova, MCC’s director of research and evaluation and a co-author of the report. “But really high percentages of young adult respondents to our survey said they felt anxious, depressed, or both.At the same time, the report argues, young adults have many strengths that provide many reasons for hope\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) is a leading institution focused on education research, practice, and policy, known for its faculty expertise and community initiatives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICHARD WEISSBOURD<|>PERSON<|>Richard Weissbourd is the faculty director of Making Caring Common and a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, known for his work on young adults' mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAKING CARING COMMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Making Caring Common (MCC) is a project of the Harvard Graduate School of Education that focuses on promoting the well-being of young adults and addressing their mental health challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>Young adults are individuals aged 18-25 who are experiencing significant mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression, as identified in the report.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OF YOUNG ADULTS<|>EVENT<|>The report titled \"On Edge: Understanding and Preventing Young Adults’ Mental Health Challenges\" discusses the emotional challenges faced by young adults, including anxiety and depression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL SECURITY<|>EVENT<|>Financial security is a concern for young adults, contributing to their mental health challenges as reported in the study.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICHARD WEISSBOURD<|>MAKING CARING COMMON<|>Richard Weissbourd is the faculty director of Making Caring Common, leading initiatives to address young adults' mental health issues<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION<|>MAKING CARING COMMON<|>Making Caring Common is a project of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, focusing on mental health challenges among young adults<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OF YOUNG ADULTS<|>The report addresses the mental health challenges specifically faced by young adults<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>FINANCIAL SECURITY<|>Financial security is a significant concern impacting the mental health of young adults<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
