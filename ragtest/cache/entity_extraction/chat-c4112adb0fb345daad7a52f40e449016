It may be possible that some children develop poor emotional regulation due to their temperament. Differences in temperament can be observable very early in life. Some infants are calm and even-tempered, while others tend to have more intense and longer stress reactions which may contribute to poorer emotional regulation. Trauma Trauma is described as the experience of catastrophic affect an individual cannot process, understand, and/or integrate. The overwhelming intensity of feelings can automatically freeze or shut down consciousness. Many people who experience trauma, especially as a child, are likely to have poor emotional regulation. Someone who experiences trauma may have inflexible strategies to help with emotions – often one way of reacting to negative emotions. The more trauma someone has experienced as a child, such as experiencing or witnessing abuse, the more likely they are to have severe emotional dysregulation. Attachment styles Early attachment experiences shape emotion regulation abilities. Infants need caregivers to help modulate their affects through attuned bonding. Without this, children fail to develop self-soothing capacities and instead rely on external regulation. Insecure attachment styles involve suboptimal parental attunement. Caregivers may be inconsistent, unavailable, extreme, or invalidating. Children internalize these dynamics, learning unhealthy regulation habits like suppression or dramatic emotionality. The encoded patterns persist into adulthood as emotion dysregulation. Low emotional intelligence Low emotional intelligence (EI) can lead to poor emotion regulation in several ways: Limited Recognition: Those with low EI may not accurately recognize their emotions, making it hard to address them appropriately. Misunderstanding Emotions: Without understanding the causes or triggers of emotions, it’s difficult to strategize how to handle them. Impulsive Reactions: Low EI can result in knee-jerk emotional reactions without thoughtful response or self-reflection. Difficulty in Expression: People with low EI might struggle to express their emotions constructively, leading to miscommunication or conflict. Reduced Empathy: A lack of EI can mean reduced empathy for others, making interpersonal conflict more likely and harder to resolve. Ineffective Coping Strategies: Without the insight provided by higher EI, individuals might resort to maladaptive strategies like avoidance, substance abuse, or aggression. Related disorders Poor emotion regulation in childhood may increase the likelihood of developing other mental health disorders. Likewise, having a neurodevelopmental condition may come with symptoms associated with poorer emotional regulation. The following conditions can involve some difficulties with emotional regulation: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) People with this disorder often have emotional sensitivity, heightened and changeable negative moods, a deficit of appropriate regulation strategies, and a surplus of maladaptive regulation strategies. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) This condition is often diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced trauma such as violence, neglect, or abuse. In CPTSD, emotion regulation involves difficulty self-calming when distressed and chronic emotional numbing. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) This childhood condition can involve experiencing extreme moods and intense temper outbursts. There is often a lot of anger with this condition, irritability, and strong behaviors in response to negative emotions. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) Poor emotional regulation is a common symptom of autism. Individuals often have greater or more intense baseline levels of negative emotions or irritability, have poorer problem-solving skills, can become easily overstimulated, and may find it harder to detect other people’s emotions. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Poor emotional regulation is a key symptom of ADHD. Individuals with this disorder may have strong reactions to small setbacks, feel their emotions more intensely than others, have difficulty calming down, and have a low tolerance for frustration or annoyance. The cycle of distress Wanting to minimize or avoid strong and negative emotions is part of what is often called a ‘cycle of shame.’ This pattern often looks like the Experimental Avoidance Model by Chapman, Gratz, & Brown (2006). This model explains that self-harm is primarily maintained by negative reinforcement in the form of escape or avoidance of unwanted emotional experiences. This effectively levels out the rollercoaster of emotions until the next time. This can be applied to any unhelpful coping strategy that people use instead of regulating their emotions. When people use these unhelpful strategies, they do not feel good about using them despite their short-term effectiveness. These tend to add to a larger sense of shame or failure that sets the stage for the whole process to begin again. This is how it can become a vicious cycle. Breaking the distress cycle Changing any part of the cycle can interfere with the pattern and lead to more positive thoughts and feelings. Techniques such as those employed in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you learn how to understand and work with the relationship between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Learn to pay attention to the way the thought-emotion-behavior relationship works for you, then ask yourself some questions: What particular ideas or thought patterns are causing a reaction in your mind? Which emotions do you find most difficult to endure or handle? What methods or actions do you take to ease your anxiety? To what extent do these techniques provide relief in both immediate and long-term situations? Are there any fundamental convictions you hold about yourself, others, or the world that have a bearing on the negative spiral? Alternatively, what are the thoughts and convictions that contribute the most to generating positive emotions for you? It is important to note that there can be a variety of strategies that are used to deal with emotions, even overwhelming ones. What happens most often is that these strategies are not applied flexibly, and someone may use the same unhelpful strategy in every negative situation. Putting effort into questioning what thoughts you have and what coping strategies you gravitate towards is an essential step toward ending the distress cycle.
