Among a sample of North American Plains Indians, Whitbeck, Adams, et al. (2004) have shown that historical trauma affects psychological health through the experience of loss. Their research has demonstrated that, among Native Americans, the frequency of thinking about losses associated with historical traumas: is associated with distressed feelings (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004); mediates the effect of perceived discrimination on alcohol abuse (Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, & Adams, 2004); is distinct from depression (Whitbeck, Walls, Johnson, Morrisseau, & McDougall, 2009); and is a significant source of distress over and above other proximate stressors, such as childhood adversity and negative life events (Walls & Whitbeck, 2011). The empirical research on historical trauma has followed the growth of theory that links historical trauma to individual and community health. Bar-on et al. (1998) apply attachment theory to explain the preponderance of insecure-ambivalent attachment observed among children of Holocaust survivors, an observation supported in Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews of research with this population that showed a predisposition to anxiety-related disorders in later generations. Brave Heart and DeBruyn (1998) point out that government policies toward the Lakota people disrupted culture-based grieving processes, thus resulting in mass unresolved grief. A number of scholars further argue that the violent colonization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas disrupted culture-based protective factors, community systems, and parenting knowledge, thus leading to increased psychosocial risk, inadequate parenting, and health disparities in this population (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011; Crawford, 2013; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Kirmayer, Brass, & Tait, 2000). Walters et al. (2011) also contend that historically experienced traumas may be reflected in heritable biological and epigenetic mechanisms of health risk and illness. And finally, Sotero (2006) argues that, in order for theories of historical trauma to explain the link between present-day health outcomes and past trauma experienced by a particular group, they must be consistent with three overarching theoretical perspectives: 1) psychosocial theory, and specifically, the link between stress and illness; 2) political/economic theory, so as to account for structural determinants of health and illness (e.g., power inequities); and 3) social/ecological systems theory, thus accounting for multi-level influences on health and illness. These extant theories of historical trauma do not explicitly incorporate narrative as a central theoretical framework, but nor are they incompatible with such a framework. A narrative framework for historical trauma asks us to consider more carefully the nature of history. History is, in part, collective memory, and like memory, is a highly malleable, reconstructive process (see Antze & Lambek, 1996; Young, 2004; Zembylas & Bekerman, 2008). Memories of past traumatic events are constructed within social and cultural contexts, which often determine what is remembered and how it is interpreted. As Foucault (2003) points out, dominant cultures often silence or diminish the value of other cultural groups’ narratives, that is, they disqualify other people’s knowledge and limit what may be discussed publicly. Such struggles for narrative recognition may be an important element of a group’s historical trauma narrative, such as with the struggle of Armenians to have the massacres of their people by Turks during the Ottoman Empire recognized as genocide. Trauma narratives represent an interplay between personal stories and culture and, therefore, are cultural constructions of trauma (Kienzler, 2008). Cultural narratives of trauma may be especially relevant to health, perhaps more so than the actual occurrence of an event, because they frame the psychosocial, political-economic, and social-ecological context within which that event is experienced (Young, 2004). This was evident in a recent study on collective trauma in the Guinean Languette region that documented a relationship between rates of distress and variation in local community narratives of violence and cultural decimation or resilience (Abramowitz, 2005).Historical Trauma as Public Narrative By conceptualizing historical trauma as a public narrative we are focusing on narrative accounts that link past experiences of traumatization by a group or community to health over time. Narratives of past traumas and group health over time can be found throughout the world and in reference to a wide diversity of mass-experienced trauma, from a single event, such as a natural disaster (Cox & Perry, 2011), to a recurrent history of oppression and traumatization (Evans-Campbell, 2008). In the latter case, it may be most fruitful to discuss historical trauma in terms of repeated and linked injustices and traumas, some of which date back centuries and others occurring in the present day. Importantly, historical trauma narratives will also vary by person and culture, just as memory and trauma vary across people and cultures (Antze & Lambek, 1996; Young, 1997), and be influenced by the contexts of both local and dominant cultural rules of discourse (Foucault, 2003). This relationship between history, memory, and contemporary contexts highlights the dual nature of historical trauma—on the one hand, historical trauma refers to events and experiences that many people consider traumatic; on the other hand, these events are carried forward through public narratives that not only recount the events but individual and collective responses to them (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Crawford, 2013; Evans-Campbell, 200\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICAN PLAINS INDIANS<|>PERSON<|>A group of Indigenous peoples in North America whose psychological health is affected by historical trauma and loss)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKOTA PEOPLE<|>PERSON<|>A Native American tribe whose culture-based grieving processes were disrupted by government policies, leading to unresolved grief)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS<|>PERSON<|>Individuals who survived the Holocaust and whose experiences have been studied to understand the effects of historical trauma on subsequent generations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUINEAN Languette REGION<|>GEO<|>A region in Guinea where a study documented the relationship between community narratives of violence and rates of distress)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OTTOMAN EMPIRE<|>GEO<|>Historical empire where the Armenian massacres occurred, which are recognized as genocide by some groups)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARMENIANS<|>PERSON<|>Ethnic group that experienced massacres during the Ottoman Empire and seeks recognition of these events as genocide)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL NARRATIVES<|>EVENT<|>Narratives that frame the psychosocial, political-economic, and social-ecological context of traumatic events)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>The collective emotional and psychological injury over the lifespan of a group, resulting from traumatic events that are shared by the group)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICAN PLAINS INDIANS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The psychological health of North American Plains Indians is affected by historical trauma and loss<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAKOTA PEOPLE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Lakota people's unresolved grief is a result of historical trauma caused by government policies<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The experiences of Holocaust survivors have been studied to understand the effects of historical trauma on their descendants<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUINEAN Languette REGION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Guinean Languette region's community narratives of violence are linked to historical trauma<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMENIANS<|>OTTOMAN EMPIRE<|>Armenians seek recognition of the massacres they suffered during the Ottoman Empire as genocide<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL NARRATIVES<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Cultural narratives frame the context of historical trauma and influence how it is experienced<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
