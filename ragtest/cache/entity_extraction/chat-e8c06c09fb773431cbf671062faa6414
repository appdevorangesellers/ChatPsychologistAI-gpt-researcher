The prevalence of sleep disorders is higher in patients with acute or chronic medical or mental health disorders. Sleep disorders are under-recognized problems. Sleep disorders are associated with impaired mental health and physical health, as well as a reduced quality of life. Various negative daytime consequences include sleepiness, depressed mood, social isolation and decreased productivity. Patients usually seek professional help because of daytime symptoms and/or dysfunction. Treatment potentially alleviates or reduces negative daytime symptoms and improves quality of life, although more research is clearly desirable in this area. Specific clinical subpopulations suffering from sleep disorders should be identified for more targeted interventions.\nTables Table 1.
