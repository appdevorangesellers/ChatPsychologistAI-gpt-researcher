Although some changes are welcome and needed, others have been controversial. In this article, I examine the diagnostic changes along with some of the associated controversies and resolutions. The implications for the practice of child forensic psychiatry, including problems that may be encountered by forensic psychiatrists who evaluate adults with childhood-onset mental disorders, are examined. The pitfalls associated with improper use of The Manual by legal professionals are also reviewed.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 represents the culmination of a multinational\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health, including the classification of diseases and health problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>American Psychiatric Publishing is a publisher of books and journals related to psychiatry, including the DSM-5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is a manual used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUSKY V.
