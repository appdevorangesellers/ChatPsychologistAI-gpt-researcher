The study examined three different signs of biological aging—early puberty, cellular aging and changes in brain structure—and found that trauma exposure was associated with all three. “Exposure to adversity in childhood is a powerful predictor of health outcomes later in life—not only mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety, but also physical health outcomes like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer,” said Katie McLaughlin, PhD, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard University and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Psychological Association is a professional organization representing psychologists in the United States, involved in research and advocacy related to psychological science.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATIE MCLAUGHLIN<|>PERSON<|>Katie McLaughlin is an associate professor of psychology at Harvard University, known for her research on the effects of childhood trauma on health outcomes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARVARD UNIVERSITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Harvard University is a prestigious Ivy League university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, known for its research and academic excellence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDHOOD TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Childhood trauma refers to adverse experiences during childhood, such as abuse or violence, which can have long-lasting effects on health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASHINGTON<|>GEO<|>Washington is the capital city of the United States, where the American Psychological Association is headquartered.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATIE MCLAUGHLIN<|>HARVARD UNIVERSITY<|>Katie McLaughlin is an associate professor at Harvard University, contributing to research in psychology<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION<|>KATIE MCLAUGHLIN<|>Katie McLaughlin's research on childhood trauma is published and recognized by the American Psychological Association<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION<|>CHILDHOOD TRAUMA<|>The American Psychological Association conducts research and advocacy related to childhood trauma and its effects<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDHOOD TRAUMA<|>KATIE MCLAUGHLIN<|>Katie McLaughlin's research focuses on the impact of childhood trauma on health outcomes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION<|>HARVARD UNIVERSITY<|>The American Psychological Association collaborates with academic institutions like Harvard University for research and advocacy<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
