Through shaping past experience into coherent stories, narratives are the primary means by which people convey contemporary interpretations and aspirations (Bruner, 1991). In particular, people employ narratives to express both individual and collective identities (Wertsch, 2008) and to situate themselves in their social contexts (Hammack, 2008). Personal narratives are stories told by an individual and are unique to that person (Rappaport, 2000), such as a personal account of surviving a car accident. Public narratives differ from personal narratives in as much as they are expressed within public discourse (Ganz, 2011), are indicative of intersubjective understanding (O’Donnell & Tharp, 2012), and are common among a group of people (Rappaport, 2000). Public narratives, thus, are the stories that shape collective memory through reliance on narrative elements such as characters, actions, places, and time (Wertsch, 2008). For example, for one village in the Guinean Languette, the local public narrative recounting the collective memory of attacks by Sierra Leonean Liberation forces includes details regarding who perpetrated the attacks at what sites and when, as well as the armed resistance of village youth, and the period of struggle, poverty, and loss following the attacks (Abramowitz, 2005). We draw a distinction between personal and public by considering whether the story is uniquely told by an individual or whether it exists in a broader social and cultural discourse.Psychological Health and Public Narratives A substantial body of research shows a connection between different varieties of narratives and individual and community health. Individuals use narratives to understand traumatic experiences, and often report that they have changed negatively or positively in the aftermath of an experience (McAdams, Reynolds, Lewis, Patten, & Bowman, 2001; Tebes, Irish, Puglisi Vasquez, & Perkins, 2004). A common narrative recounts how one has been irrevocably injured or tainted by adversity (Degloma, 2009). For some, such an account yields a contamination narrative in which positive events are reinterpreted as leading to negative outcomes that result in decrements to well-being (McAdams et al., 2001). For example, the birth of a child may be interpreted as leading to increased stress and social isolation, especially when past trauma experiences are associated with related stressors. For others, the aftermath of trauma leads to a narrative of cognitive transformation or redemption in which a negative life experience is later viewed in positive terms, often after a period of personal struggle (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004). For example, one may see benefit in becoming more self-reliant after the death of a parent so as to result in a positive reinterpretation of the event’s aftermath, despite the pain caused by the loss. In contrast to contamination narratives, redemption and cognitive transformation narratives are positively associated with well-being and resilience (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004). Such personal narratives are contextualized within public narratives that inform how adversity is viewed within the broader culture or by a specific cultural group (Pals & McAdams, 2004). Public narratives may frame how post-traumatic growth, as one example, is even possible within a given socio-cultural context (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). Affiliation with group identity and knowledge of the narratives of that group can be a source of resilience for marginalized groups. For example, for indigenous youth and sexual minority youth, group affiliation can encourage a sense of participation in a political struggle evidencing collective strength (Wexler et al., 2009). Resilience in response to adversity and trauma is, in this way, a process in negotiation with influential public narratives such as those conveying group histories of trauma and survival. Just as individuals express resilience through narratives of transformation following traumatic events (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004), so too do groups and communities represent group resilience in narratives of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008; Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) illustrates this effectively by tracing how narrative frames family identity and resilience strategies through four generations of an American Indian family. Family and public narratives, hence, influence the formation of personal narratives, the interpretation of one’s contexts, and the response to personal and collective traumas. Psychological well-being is related to one’s ability to process narratives and form coherent life stories and interpretations (Pals, 2006; Ville & Khlat, 2006). For example, the ability to develop autobiographical coherence linking one’s sense of self to the past and future, referred to as self-continuity, is predictive of suicide risk (Chandler, 1994). Like self-continuity, Chandler and Lalonde (2009) have shown how cultural-continuity—the degree to which a community engages in actions symbolic of their sense of community as a cultural group—functions as a protective factor and moderator of behavioral health problems among some indigenous Canadian communities. Historical trauma that results from colonization may lead to diminished cultural continuity, which may lead to limited collective action to preserve and advance a cultural legacy (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009). Conversely, narratives of continuity and cultural revitalization promote resiliency (Kirmayer, Dandeneau, Marshall, Phillips, & Williamson, 2011). Strong cultural identity may be emblematic of public resilience in the face of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Gone\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>GEO<|>The Guinean Languette is a region where local public narratives recount collective memories of attacks and struggles faced by its inhabitants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIERRA LEONEAN LIBERATION FORCES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Sierra Leonean Liberation Forces are a group involved in attacks that are part of the collective memory of the Guinean Languette.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>An American Indian family whose narrative spans four generations, illustrating family identity and resilience strategies.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIGENOUS YOUTH<|>PERSON<|>Indigenous youth who may find strength and resilience through group affiliation and narratives of political struggle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH<|>PERSON<|>Sexual minority youth who can draw resilience from collective narratives and group identity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>EVENT<|>Cultural continuity refers to the degree to which a community engages in actions that symbolize their sense of community as a cultural group.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma is the collective emotional and psychological injury over generations resulting from traumatic events, such as colonization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POST-TRAUMATIC GROWTH<|>EVENT<|>Post-traumatic growth is the positive change experienced as a result of the struggle with a major life crisis or traumatic event.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>SIERRA LEONEAN LIBERATION FORCES<|>The Sierra Leonean Liberation Forces are part of the historical narrative of attacks that affected the Guinean Languette<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>The American Indian family's narrative illustrates the importance of cultural continuity across generations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIGENOUS YOUTH<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>Indigenous youth's resilience is linked to their community's cultural continuity and narratives<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>Sexual minority youth find strength in cultural continuity and shared narratives within their communities<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>Historical trauma can diminish cultural continuity, affecting community resilience<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POST-TRAUMATIC GROWTH<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Post-traumatic growth can occur in response to historical trauma, leading to resilience<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
