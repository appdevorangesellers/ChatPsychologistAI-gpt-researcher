Among the sociodemographic factors,\nthe likelihood of flourishing mentally decreased with drop-\nping out of college (b = −0.561; p < .001). Age (b = 0.036;\np < .01) was positively associated with flourishing mentally.\nAmong the factors related to parental influence, closeness\nto the mother (b = 0.098; p < .001) was significant and pos-\nitively associated with flourishing mentally.\nCompared\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n6\n5\nto the baseline of respondents with moderate\nmental health scores, the determinants of respondents who\nlanguished are shown in Columns 4–6 of Table 2.

Among the financial\nsituation-related factors, income (b = 0.002; p < .05) and\nfamily wealth (b = 0.126; p < .01) in the current period were\npositively associated with an increase in mental health (bet-\nter mental health) score. Conversely, the amount of student\nloans (b = −0.003; p < .001) and credit card debt (b = −0.007;\np < .01) in the previous period were negatively associated\nwith an increase in mental health score. Among the per-\nceived abilities and health-related factors, the perceptions of\nbeing responsible (b = 0.128; p < .001), being a problem-\nsolver (b = 0.013; p < .05), being good at managing money\n(b = 0.014; p < .01), and being in excellent health (b = 0.129;\np < .001) were positively associated with an increase in men-\ntal health score over time.\nDiscussion\nI\nD\n:\nt\ni\n0\n1\n2\n0\nThis\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n2\n7\n5\nstudy examined the factors associated with the mental\nhealth state of young adults, with a specific focus on finan-\ncial well-being and their perceived financial capabilities.\nThe results from the fixed effects analysis with time-varying\nPdf_Folio:194\n194\nJournal of Financial Counseling and Planning, Volume 32, Number 2, 2021\n\nfactors indicate that the amounts of student loans and credit\ncard debt in the previous period were associated with nega-\ntive changes in mental health continuum scores across time.\nAdditionally, the amount of credit card debt was negatively\nassociated with flourishing and positively associated with\nlanguishing in the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication that focuses on financial counseling and planning, examining factors associated with mental health and financial well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>PERSON<|>A demographic group that the study focuses on, particularly regarding their mental health and financial well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>EVENT<|>A state of psychological well-being that is influenced by various factors including financial situations and personal capabilities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDIT CARD DEBT<|>EVENT<|>A financial obligation that has been shown to negatively impact mental health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUDENT LOANS<|>EVENT<|>A type of financial debt that is associated with negative changes in mental health scores over time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL WELL-BEING<|>EVENT<|>A state that encompasses an individual's financial health and its impact on mental health.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG ADULTS<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>The study examines the mental health state of young adults, focusing on their financial well-being and perceived financial capabilities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREDIT CARD DEBT<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>Credit card debt is negatively associated with flourishing and positively associated with languishing in mental health<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STUDENT LOANS<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>Student loans are associated with negative changes in mental health scores over time<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL WELL-BEING<|>MENTAL HEALTH<|>Financial well-being is linked to mental health, with various financial factors influencing mental health outcomes<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
