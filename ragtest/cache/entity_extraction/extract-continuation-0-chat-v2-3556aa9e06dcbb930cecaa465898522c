The physiological, attachment, and meta-cognitive disturbances seen in traumatized children intersect at multiple levels of Bronfenbrenner's model. More specifically, children and adolescents who have experienced severe trauma and ACEs experience high rates of poverty, legal problems, and violence exposure (89, 104–106). Abusive parents often have experienced their own traumas and attachment disturbances (107–109), which are often compounded by high rates of substance abuse, depression, financial stress, and unemployment (12, 110–113). Racial, ethnic, sexual, and neurodiverse minorities are affected by developmental trauma at very high rates (114, 115), suggesting that systemic factors such as state and national policies, allocation of resources for prevention and intervention, discrimination, and stigma exert influence over, and significantly impact responses to, trauma and recovery. Children with trauma live in persistent states of fear and terror, and recurring traumas become transformative developmental experiences that alter their global appraisals and future responses to stress (14, 49, 61, 116). This heightened fear propensity disrupts self-awareness, information processing, interpersonal communication, and mastery of age-appropriate developmental competencies [e.g., establishing healthy relationship parameters, identifying and expressing feelings appropriately, and tolerating ambiguity; (43, 90)] and causes individuals to have problems learning, making friends at school, and appreciating their strengths and unique abilities, which are often overshadowed by their social and behavioral difficulties. Researchers have described several adverse physiological alterations underlying cognitive disturbances in children who have experienced early traumas (13, 117–124). These include, for example, stress-mediated changes to the organization and functioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, which exert influence over fear processing, including automatic (impulsive) behavioral responses to perceived threats (125–130), learning and memory [fear memories override attention, concentration, and, in turn, inhibit learning of new information; (72, 131, 132)], and higher-order (complex) cognitive operations [e.g., problem-solving and learning from experience, stress appraisal and reappraisal, perceived controllability; (133–135)]. As an illustration of this, reinforcement and contingency learning studies indicate that children who had experienced severe adversity or developmental trauma are not able to adjust their behavior effectively to shifting environments or demands, regardless of threatening and non-threatening circumstances (136, 137). These findings suggest that individuals who have endured significant stress in their lives, especially during early childhood or adolescence, are at increased risk of experiencing avoidance, anger, frustration, and anxiety as primary ways of being in the world, regardless of their circumstances (138–140). These types of responses can be damaging to an individual's development and ability to function, particularly if their safety needs are undermined. Repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents become habituated to evaluating their surroundings for indications of threat that might render them vulnerable to additional traumas, given that they had limited opportunities to recover from the early and repeated abuse and neglect. Researchers speculate that the mechanisms involved in the development of traumatic stress adaptations correlate with diverse, interrelated psychiatric symptoms and comorbidities often reported in studies of individuals who have experienced repeated abuse and neglect. This notion is consistent with a socio-ecological framework, the developmental trauma diagnosis, and trans-theoretical models that focus on far-reaching (cross-diagnostic) effects from critical and sensitive periods, attachment and social cognition (e.g., mentalizing and perspective taking), sleep, physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and mood and personality (141–143). The role of attachment Prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers. According to attachment theorists, securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregivers to minimize anxiety and to form goal-directed partnerships, and/or interactional synchrony, where they mirror each other's communication patterns and learn to anticipate, express, and meet each other's needs. Through these interactions, children develop internal working models, which encompass individuals' core beliefs about their self-worth and lovability as well as their general expectations of others in relationships (144). Insecure attachment styles (e.g., anxious, avoidant, and disorganized) are frequently associated with interpersonal trauma (145–147). Studies have consistently linked attachment disturbances to the emergence (and maintenance) of developmental trauma symptoms, which may remain latent until interpersonal interactions later in life (e.g., peer conflicts, inadequate institutional responses to trauma, workplace challenges) give rise to memories of early trauma (148). The combination of repeated childhood trauma and the absence of parental nurturing, support, and protection (e.g., parents who are addicted to alcohol and/or drugs, are homeless, or are living in severe poverty; family violence; parental incarceration) can be particularly devastating and can potentiate DT (34, 145, 149, 150).Social cognition Cognitive science researchers have expanded upon attachment concepts to include the construct of mentalizing, which is defined as the capacity to consider the mental states of others (e.g., inferring their needs, goals, interests, and intersubjective experiences) as distinct from one's own. Mentalizing has been described in the literature as reflective functioning, theory of mind, metacognition, insight, and perspective-taking (151). Mentalizing deficits have been reported in several clinical populations, including individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and more recently, developmental traumas (152–155). Children and adolescents with DT demonstrate impaired mentalizing (i.e., reflecting functioning), referring to the capacity to effectively understand oneself\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRONFENBRENNER'S MODEL<|>EVENT<|>Bronfenbrenner's model is a theoretical framework that explains how various levels of influence affect individual development, particularly in the context of trauma and adverse childhood experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>EVENT<|>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) refer to traumatic events occurring before the age of 18 that can have lasting effects on health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Developmental Trauma (DT) is a diagnosis that encompasses the effects of prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma on a child's development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Traumatized children are those who have experienced severe trauma and adverse childhood experiences, leading to various psychological and developmental challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURE ATTACHMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Secure attachments are healthy emotional bonds formed between children and caregivers that help minimize anxiety and foster healthy development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT STYLES<|>EVENT<|>Insecure attachment styles are maladaptive patterns of relating to others that can arise from early trauma and disrupt healthy interpersonal relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTALIZING<|>EVENT<|>Mentalizing is the capacity to understand the mental states of oneself and others, which is crucial for effective social interactions and relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEMIC FACTORS<|>EVENT<|>Systemic factors refer to broader societal influences, such as policies and resource allocation, that impact individual and community responses to trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACIAL, ETHNIC, SEXUAL, AND NEURODIVERSE MINORITIES<|>PERSON<|>These groups are disproportionately affected by developmental trauma, facing unique challenges and systemic barriers in recovery.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Traumatized children often experience adverse childhood experiences, which contribute to their psychological and developmental issues.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>Developmental trauma is a condition that affects traumatized children, influencing their emotional and psychological development.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURE ATTACHMENTS<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>Traumatized children often struggle to form secure attachments due to their experiences of trauma.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT STYLES<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>Insecure attachment styles frequently develop in traumatized children, affecting their future relationships.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENTALIZING<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>Traumatized children may exhibit deficits in mentalizing, impacting their social interactions and relationships.<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEMIC FACTORS<|>TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN<|>Systemic factors can exacerbate the challenges faced by traumatized children, influencing their recovery and support systems.<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RACIAL, ETHNIC, SEXUAL, AND NEURODIVERSE MINORITIES<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Racial, ethnic, sexual, and neurodiverse minorities are significantly affected by developmental trauma, facing unique systemic challenges.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
