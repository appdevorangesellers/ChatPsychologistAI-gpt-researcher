Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews show that children of Holocaust survivors from Israel to Canada are more vulnerable to PTSD, and Barel, Van IJzendoorn, Sagi-Schwartz, and Bakermans-Kranenburg’s (2010) meta-analysis shows that second and third generation offspring of Holocaust survivors display both remarkable resilience and heightened post-traumatic stress symptoms. Daoud, Shankardass, O’Campo, Anderson, and Agbaria (2012) documented lower self-rated health, poorer socio-economic status, and higher stress among Palestinians displaced during the Nakba of 1948 and their descendants in comparison to families who were not displaced. Karenian et al. (2011) found elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms among descendants of the Armenian genocide that, while persistent, seem to be fading with every subsequent generation. Several studies of Canadian First Nations indigenous peoples have found that a family history of forced boarding school attendance and removal from one’s family and community is associated with a number of subsequent behavioral health challenges in later generations, including: increased exposure to sexual violence and involvement in child welfare systems (Pearce et al., 2008), injection drug use (Lemstra, Rogers, Thompson, Moraros, & Buckingham, 2012), current depressive symptoms and increased exposure to trauma (Bombay, Matheson, & Anisman, 2011), and a history of abuse associated with suicidal thoughts and attempts (Elias et al., 2012). Among a sample of North American Plains Indians, Whitbeck, Adams, et al. (2004) have shown that historical trauma affects psychological health through the experience of loss. Their research has demonstrated that, among Native Americans, the frequency of thinking about losses associated with historical traumas: is associated with distressed feelings (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004); mediates the effect of perceived discrimination on alcohol abuse (Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, & Adams, 2004); is distinct from depression (Whitbeck, Walls, Johnson, Morrisseau, & McDougall, 2009); and is a significant source of distress over and above other proximate stressors, such as childhood adversity and negative life events (Walls & Whitbeck, 2011). The empirical research on historical trauma has followed the growth of theory that links historical trauma to individual and community health. Bar-on et al. (1998) apply attachment theory to explain the preponderance of insecure-ambivalent attachment observed among children of Holocaust survivors, an observation supported in Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews of research with this population that showed a predisposition to anxiety-related disorders in later generations. Brave Heart and DeBruyn (1998) point out that government policies toward the Lakota people disrupted culture-based grieving processes, thus resulting in mass unresolved grief. A number of scholars further argue that the violent colonization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas disrupted culture-based protective factors, community systems, and parenting knowledge, thus leading to increased psychosocial risk, inadequate parenting, and health disparities in this population (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011; Crawford, 2013; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Kirmayer, Brass, & Tait, 2000). Walters et al. (2011) also contend that historically experienced traumas may be reflected in heritable biological and epigenetic mechanisms of health risk and illness. And finally, Sotero (2006) argues that, in order for theories of historical trauma to explain the link between present-day health outcomes and past trauma experienced by a particular group, they must be consistent with three overarching theoretical perspectives: 1) psychosocial theory, and specifically, the link between stress and illness; 2) political/economic theory, so as to account for structural determinants of health and illness (e.g., power inequities); and 3) social/ecological systems theory, thus accounting for multi-level influences on health and illness. These extant theories of historical trauma do not explicitly incorporate narrative as a central theoretical framework, but nor are they incompatible with such a framework. A narrative framework for historical trauma asks us to consider more carefully the nature of history. History is, in part, collective memory, and like memory, is a highly malleable, reconstructive process (see Antze & Lambek, 1996; Young, 2004; Zembylas & Bekerman, 2008). Memories of past traumatic events are constructed within social and cultural contexts, which often determine what is remembered and how it is interpreted. As Foucault (2003) points out, dominant cultures often silence or diminish the value of other cultural groups’ narratives, that is, they disqualify other people’s knowledge and limit what may be discussed publicly. Such struggles for narrative recognition may be an important element of a group’s historical trauma narrative, such as with the struggle of Armenians to have the massacres of their people by Turks during the Ottoman Empire recognized as genocide. Trauma narratives represent an interplay between personal stories and culture and, therefore, are cultural constructions of trauma (Kienzler, 2008). Cultural narratives of trauma may be especially relevant to health, perhaps more so than the actual occurrence of an event, because they frame the psychosocial, political-economic, and social-ecological context within which that event is experienced (Young, 2004). This was evident in a recent study on collective trauma in the Guinean Languette region that documented a relationship between rates of distress and variation in local community narratives of violence and cultural decimation or resilience (Abramowitz, 200\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
