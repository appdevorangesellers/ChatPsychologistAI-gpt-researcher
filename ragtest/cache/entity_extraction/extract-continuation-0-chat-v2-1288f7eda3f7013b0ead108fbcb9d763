As a consequence of this rapid growth, the literature on historical trauma comprises disparate terminology and research approaches. This critical review integrates this literature in order to specify theoretical mechanisms that explain how historical trauma influences the health of individuals and communities. We argue that historical trauma functions as a public narrative for particular groups or communities that connects present-day experiences and circumstances to the trauma so as to influence health. Treating historical trauma as a public narrative shifts the research discourse away from an exclusive search for past causal variables that influence health to identifying how present-day experiences, their corresponding narratives, and their health impacts are connected to public narratives of historical trauma for a particular group or community. We discuss how the connection between historical trauma and present-day experiences, related narratives, and health impacts may function as a source of present-day distress as well as resilience.\nKeywords: Historical trauma, personal narratives, public narratives, resilience, community health\nHistorical trauma refers to a complex and collective trauma experienced over time and across generations by a group of people who share an identity, affiliation, or circumstance (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Crawford, 2013; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Gone, 2013). Although historical trauma was originally introduced to describe the experience of children of Holocaust survivors (Kellermann, 2001a), in the past two decades, the term has been applied to numerous colonized indigenous groups throughout the world, as well as African Americans, Armenian refugees, Japanese American survivors of internment camps, Swedish immigrant children whose parents were torture victims, Palestinian youth, the people of Cyprus, Belgians, Cambodians, Israelis, Mexicans and Mexican Americans, Russians, and many other cultural groups and communities that share a history of oppression, victimization, or massive group trauma exposure (Baker & Gippenreiter, 1998; Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011; Daud, Skoglund, & Rydelius, 2005; Karenian et al., 2011; Sotero, 2006; Wexler, DiFluvio, & Burke, 2009). Scholars from various disciplines have described the generational aspect of historical trauma as transgenerational, intergenerational, multi-generational, or cross-generational (Bar-On et al., 1998; Kellermann, 2001b), and have introduced concepts, such as soul wound (Duran, 2006; Duran & Duran, 1995) or Post Traumatic Slavery Syndrome (Leary, 2005), to capture the collective experience of trauma by specific cultural groups\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Yale University School of Medicine<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yale University School of Medicine is an academic institution located in New Haven, CT, focusing on medical education and research.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Central Connecticut State University<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Central Connecticut State University is a public university located in New Britain, CT, offering a range of undergraduate and graduate programs.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>PERSON<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes is a researcher affiliated with the Division of Prevention & Community Research at Yale University School of Medicine, serving as the corresponding author for the document.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the collective trauma experienced over generations by specific cultural groups due to oppression and victimization.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JACOB KRAEMER TEBES<|>Yale University School of Medicine<|>Jacob Kraemer Tebes is affiliated with Yale University School of Medicine as a researcher in the Division of Prevention & Community Research.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Yale University School of Medicine<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Research conducted at Yale University School of Medicine includes studies on historical trauma and its effects on health.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Central Connecticut State University<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Department of Psychological Science at Central Connecticut State University may engage in research related to historical trauma and its implications.<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
