Cox and Perry (2011) show how narratives portraying positive outcomes, such as strengthened sense of community, as well as negative ones, such as feelings of anxiety towards the stability and safety of place, were evident following this disaster. They also show how each of these narratives were related to people’s sense of place. In another example, Long and Wong (2012) describe how the tension between national and local sense of recovery time following the Wenchuan earthquake in China exacerbated a sense of communal trauma. Instead of allowing community members to recover from this disaster at a pace that accommodated their personal and public narratives, members were deluged with national support and public expectations for a speedy recovery that conflicted with these narratives, thus increasing negative health impacts following the disaster. Although these examples are not intergenerational, they illustrate how a place-based trauma can remain part of a community’s cultural identity through a prevailing public narrative of loss or resilience.\nPlace-based historical trauma narratives can also encode resilience, as is evident by public responses to the great Chicago fire of 1871, which decimated the new city but fostered an altered public identity for its surviving residents and subsequent generations. Many Chicagoans take pride in referring to Chicago as “the second city” because it depicts how the city was rebuilt using brick (rather than wood) following the great fire, how it “[rose] from [its] ashes, a greater city than before” (Shaw, 1921, p. 177). Not only is the narrative one of resilience and thriving, but the mostly brick buildings throughout Chicago serve as a contemporary reminder that heightens the narrative salience of “the second city” and the resilience of its inhabitants.\nAs Pollack (2003) notes based on his research in Bosnia-Herzegovina, mass trauma experiences can damage people’s relationships to place, but social acts and symbols that re-narrate the connection between physical and social environments can counteract the negative consequences of trauma. Regardless of whether the past traumas are felt based on place, ethnicity, or other social, cultural, or contextual groupings, the public narratives created in response to trauma influence one’s sense of identity.\nHistory provides a narrative context within which contemporary social issues are interpreted. By incorporating a rich understanding of community or group history into social science research on health, we improve the local relevance and responsiveness of research findings and enhance the ability of interventions to leverage community-level and culturally-relevant strategies and variables (Trickett et al., 2011). Should the history contain trauma, the questions become in what ways the historical traumas may or may not be present or impactful and how we might as people and communities respond to these histories in order to promote resilience.\nPresent-day political forces are increasingly calling for dominant cultures to apologize for historical traumas and document the “truth” of the traumas. In theory, truth commissions promise to repair damage of past abuses through rhetorical strategies that change the dominant cultural narrative to an admission of guilt and wrong doing (Edwards, 2010). Yet, research on the impact of truth commissions is mixed. Evidence from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission suggests that the commission improved general knowledge but had little to no impact on participant well-being (Kaminer, Stein, Mbanga, & Zungu-Dirwayi, 2001; Stein et al., 2008). Miller (2006) argues that for Canadian First Nations the social-political forms of these apologies may be incongruous with First Nations cultural practices and expectations of reconciliation, thereby limiting their benefit for the aggrieved cultures while benefiting (yet again) the dominant culture. The politics of apology and recognition are thorny—the “political economy of trauma” may do more to benefit the dominant cultures who are apologizing, maintaining their dominance and power, or may help usher in a new period of greater equality (James, 2004). We argue that studying narratives of historical trauma can help disentangle the ways in which contemporary actions perpetrate or repair historical wounds.\nOur critical review of historical trauma as a public narrative offers a framework for analyzing how historical traumas are relayed and connected to present-day contexts and health outcomes. Public narratives of historical trauma interact with contemporary reminders of these stories. The reminders serve to make the public narrative more or less salient to particular individuals, families, groups, and communities. The degree of narrative salience, in turn, influences the interpretation of an historical trauma response that manifests as a health impact. Importantly, we suggest that these linkages are recursive, that is, they operate in both directions such that the historical trauma narratives and health impacts mutually influence one another.\nAt the heart of our review is the conviction that research into historical trauma should remain trained on present-day factors. We believe there are two critical reasons for this. First, we cannot go back in time to document what precisely happened in the past; our knowledge of the past is contained in narrative. And second, as Young (1997) shows, trauma is a present day construct based on contemporary modes of representation and interpretation. Therefore, since we cannot assume that our notions of trauma can be validly projected back through time, our efforts should focus on how the panoply of social science research methods can seek to understand and explain how present day historical trauma narratives impact health.\nWe view our proposed narrative model as a heuristic for conducting such research, and believe it is relevant to the many social science disciplines currently engaged in studying historical trauma. We also believe that narrative methods are essential to documenting the processes that link public narratives of historical trauma to health outcomes, including experiences of contemporary reminders and the salience given to specific narratives. However, we also believe that a range of mixed methods (Tebes, 2012)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
