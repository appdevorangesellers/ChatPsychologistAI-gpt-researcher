School attendance and parent-reported behavior at home also improved (Baker-Henningham and others 2012). This study demonstrates that school-based interventions in a middle-income country are effective and feasible in reducing behavioral problems in young children.Bullying or peer victimization is a specific form of aggression defined as “a form of aggression in which one or more children repeatedly and intentionally intimidate, harass, or physically harm a victim” (Vreeman and Carroll 2007). The long-term impacts of bullying behavior are serious; children who are victims, bullies, or both have elevated rates of psychiatric disorders in childhood and early adulthood (Copeland and others 2013). Accordingly, the prevention of peer victimization in schools is an important strategy to reduce the occurrence of mental disorders and other adverse consequences in children and adults.Different approaches to reducing bullying behavior have been assessed in the literature. In one systematic review, Vreeman and Carroll (2007) grouped the interventions into three main types: curriculum interventions, whole-of-school approaches, and social and behavioral skills training. Whole-of-school approaches have been found to be effective; these approaches use a multidisciplinary approach that includes combinations of school rules and sanctions, classroom curriculum, teacher training, individual counseling, and conflict resolution training. In a meta-analysis, Ttofi and Farrington (2011) found that school-based anti-bullying programs can reduce bullying by about 20 percent, with greater effects observed in interventions that adopt more of a whole-of-school approach. However, very few, if any, evaluations of interventions to prevent bullying have been conducted in LMICs.Further research is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of school-based interventions supporting children with autism and intellectual disability.Voluntary Sector ProgramsAgencies in the voluntary sector (those that are nongovernment and not for-profit) have traditionally played an important role in raising awareness of the issues faced by children with mental health difficulties and their families, as well as in reducing the associated stigma. In some countries, the voluntary sector provides the bulk of child mental health services. However, the evidence base for such interventions is poor, largely because of the absence of research support for program evaluation. The magnitude of mental health problems affecting children and the absence of policies to guide service development are significant barriers to coordinated service provision and evaluation of voluntary sector programs for children in LMICs (Omigbodun 2008; Patel and Thara 2003).Health Care Platform InterventionsScreening and Community Rehabilitation for Developmental DisordersProviding early interventions to children with developmental disorders may optimize their developmental outcomes (Sonnander 2000). Screening is necessary to identify children in need of these resource-intensive interventions. Screening instruments for LMICs need to be culturally acceptable and have sound psychometric properties that have been validated in the local context (Robertson and others 2012). Instruments developed for screening children for developmental disorders in HICs (such as Denver II) may not be appropriate (Gladstone and others 2008). For example, items assessing whether a child can cut using scissors or catch a bouncing ball may be inappropriate if these resources are unavailable in the community or if parents do not model or encourage these activities. A systematic review identified instruments that have been used for the developmental screening of young children in LMICs (Robertson and others 2012). Two of the screening tools identified as useful were the Ten Questions (TQ) screen (Belmont 1986; Zaman and others 1990) and the ACCESS portfolio (Wirz and others 2005).The TQ screen (box 8.2) is a brief questionnaire administered to parents of children ages two to nine years. Five questions assess cognitive ability; two questions assess movement ability; one question addresses any history of seizures; one assesses vision; and one assesses hearing. The items require a dichotomous response of yes-no and ask about the skills that children will acquire in any culture. They ask parents to compare their children to other children in their community (Belmont 1986; Zaman and others 1990). The TQ was included as a disability module in the third round of the United Nations Children’s Fund Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and administered to almost 200,000 children across 18 countries (Gottlieb and others 2009). The TQ is a sensitive tool that identifies 80–100 percent of children with developmental disorders; however, it has a low specificity, necessitating a second stage to examine those children who screen positive (Durkin and others 1994).Box 8.2Ten Questions Screen. Compared with other children, did the child have any serious delay in sitting, standing, or walking? Compared with other children, does the child have difficulty seeing, either in the daytime or night?Administration of the ACCESS portfolio provides screening of children with developmental disorders, as well as simple advice to parents. Community health workers (CHWs) in Sri Lanka and Uganda used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children younger than age three years whose mothers had expressed concerns. The CHWs’ assessments of delay had an 82 percent accuracy in children older than age two years, compared with those identified by medical or allied health staff, although the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument were not measured. The ACCESS portfolio raised awareness of developmental disorders in communities, and CHWs and parents reported it to be helpful (Wirz and others 2005).Two significant issues arise following the identification of children with developmental disorders. The first involves the stigma associated with these diagnoses in some countries and cultures. The second is the limited evidence for the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation for children with intellectual disabilities and autism in LMICs. These issues do not necessarily indicate that interventions are ineffective, but\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
