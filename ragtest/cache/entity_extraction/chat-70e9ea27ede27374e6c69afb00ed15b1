Importantly, historical trauma narratives will also vary by person and culture, just as memory and trauma vary across people and cultures (Antze & Lambek, 1996; Young, 1997), and be influenced by the contexts of both local and dominant cultural rules of discourse (Foucault, 2003). This relationship between history, memory, and contemporary contexts highlights the dual nature of historical traumaâ€”on the one hand, historical trauma refers to events and experiences that many people consider traumatic; on the other hand, these events are carried forward through public narratives that not only recount the events but individual and collective responses to them (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Crawford, 2013; Evans-Campbell, 2008).\nAlthough we view historical trauma as narrative, it is important to recognize that these narratives are tied to real injustices or disasters. A narrative conceptualization does not deny the veracity of past traumatic events, but rather redirects oneâ€™s focus on how those events are represented and linked to health outcomes today. In this way, historical trauma consists of public narratives that link traumatic events in the historic past to contemporary local contexts so that the trauma becomes part of the contemporary cultural narrative. For example, whereas the fact of boarding schools existence in the history of Native Americans is undisputed, a contemporary narrative explains that the forced removal of children from their families caused the loss of traditional parenting practices among many communities and families, thereby harming the parenting ability of subsequent generations which partially explains behavioral health disparities (Evans-Campbell, Walters, Pearson, & Campbell, 2012). Similarly, without disputing the veracity of the Jewish Holocaust or Palestinian Nakba, we can identify contemporary historical trauma narratives that link these past injustices to present-day social and health conditionsâ€”each cultural group views the Holocaust or the Nakba respectively as a great tragedy to befall their people with continued ramifications in contemporary life (Barel et al., 2010; Masalha, 2008). The ways in which people and cultures represent and respond to past traumas become more central than an examination of the facts when we consider historical trauma as narrative.\nUnderstanding historical trauma as a public narrative thus reframes the discussion of historical trauma from a search for historical explanation towards recognition of the contemporary experience of historical trauma and the ways in which current public narratives impact health. A central problem for the scientific study of how the past influence present health is that past events are contestable, as outlined in our discussion on memory and historical narratives, and fundamentally distal to the more proximate factors that influence present health. Whitbeck, Adams, et al. (2004) provide guidance on how one might disentangle proximal versus distal causes when examining the effects of historical trauma. Since one cannot readily measure the impact of past events, sometimes centuries past, on present conditions, they propose examining historical trauma influences on current behavior through oneâ€™s psychological experience of historical loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Specifically, their research has demonstrated empirical links between thinking about historical loss and psychological health indicators, thus emphasizing how the public narrative of historical loss represents a contemporary stressor that has specific and measureable health implications.\nDefining Public Narratives\nNarratives are stories that string together events to construct meaning and establish discourse (Hinyard & Kreuter, 2007; Riessman, 1993). Through shaping past experience into coherent stories, narratives are the primary means by which people convey contemporary interpretations and aspirations (Bruner, 1991). In particular, people employ narratives to express both individual and collective identities (Wertsch, 2008) and to situate themselves in their social contexts (Hammack, 2008). Personal narratives are stories told by an individual and are unique to that person (Rappaport, 2000), such as a personal account of surviving a car accident. Public narratives differ from personal narratives in as much as they are expressed within public discourse (Ganz, 2011), are indicative of intersubjective understanding (Oâ€™Donnell & Tharp, 2012), and are common among a group of people (Rappaport, 2000). Public narratives, thus, are the stories that shape collective memory through reliance on narrative elements such as characters, actions, places, and time (Wertsch, 2008). For example, for one village in the Guinean Languette, the local public narrative recounting the collective memory of attacks by Sierra Leonean Liberation forces includes details regarding who perpetrated the attacks at what sites and when, as well as the armed resistance of village youth, and the period of struggle, poverty, and loss following the attacks (Abramowitz, 2005). We draw a distinction between personal and public by considering whether the story is uniquely told by an individual or whether it exists in a broader social and cultural discourse.\nPsychological Health and Public Narratives\nA substantial body of research shows a connection between different varieties of narratives and individual and community health. Individuals use narratives to understand traumatic experiences, and often report that they have changed negatively or positively in the aftermath of an experience (McAdams, Reynolds, Lewis, Patten, & Bowman, 2001; Tebes, Irish, Puglisi Vasquez, & Perkins, 2004). A common narrative recounts how one has been irrevocably injured or tainted by adversity (Degloma, 2009). For some, such an account yields a contamination narrative in which positive events are reinterpreted as leading to negative outcomes that result in decrements to well-being (McAdams et al., 2001). For example, the birth of a child may be interpreted as leading to increased stress and social isolation, especially\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
