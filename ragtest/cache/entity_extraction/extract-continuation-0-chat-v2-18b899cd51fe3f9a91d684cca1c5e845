Aboriginal reservations and decaying urban environments are examples of structural and physical contexts that can provide daily reminders of historic processes of loss, marginalization, discrimination, and trauma: “An empty city lot is not just the rubble of a razed building, but for the people who have seen it decay it is haunted by memories of the past” (Simms, 2008, p. 88). Also, dominant cultures often perpetuate oppressive public narratives about marginalized groups through media and other public communications, acts, and symbols (Rappaport, 2000), such as Native American sports mascots (Fryberg, Markus, Oyserman, & Stone, 2008). Personal reminders are individually experienced and relate to historical trauma through an individual’s personal narratives. Examples of personal reminders are perceived discrimination, personal life difficulties, personal trauma experiences, and microaggressions (Sue et al., 2007). As Sue et al. (2007) have noted: “…microagressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults” (p. 273). The extensive research on microaggressions provides powerful examples of how daily indignities are often embedded in narratives of historical oppression and trauma so as to serve as reminders and continuations of past oppression and trauma (Michaels, 2010).Narrative Salience Figure 1 also depicts how historical trauma narratives may be more or less salient to an individual or community. Should a person not experience nor perceive any present impact of historical trauma, a narrative of trauma will not have as much meaning to them, even if they are aware of that history. Present conditions and experiences are what make historical trauma narratives relevant to the present and future. Conversely, if a historical trauma narrative is highly salient and accessible to an individual, present conditions and daily indignities also become more readily apparent as part of the historical trauma narrative. Just as dominant cultural narratives serve as reminders of historical traumas, family and community narratives of resilience, action, and aspiration can provide a counter-weight to oppressive dominant cultural narratives (Rappaport & Simkins, 1991). Symbols of marginalization bring to life the traumas in historical trauma narratives (Evans-Campbell, 2008; Simms, 2008), whereas symbols of resistance and persistence bring to life messages of resilience and well-being (Denham, 2008; Fullilove, 1996).Health Impacts Finally, the figure also shows how narrative salience influences health impacts. Although Brave Heart (2003) emphasizes psychological distress as a common historical trauma response, as noted previously, other scholars have identified a range of negative health outcomes in response to historical trauma. For example, authors working with diverse populations throughout the world link historical traumas to such contemporary sequelae as predisposition to PTSD (Karenian et al., 2011; Kellermann, 2001b); symptoms of anxiety and depression, with a preponderance of shame and fear (Carolina Lopez, 2011; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Whitbeck et al., 2009); and disruptions to family and parent-child relationships (Bar-On et al., 1998; Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011). Similarly, numerous authors use historical trauma as an explanatory framework for understanding a wide-range of health disparities with psychological, social, and biological mechanisms (Crawford, 2013; Daley, 2006; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Sotero, 2006; Walters et al., 2011). Despite this range of potential health impacts, Gone (2013) emphasizes that the development of the notion of historical trauma originates out of the psychological literature, and therefore most discussions of historical trauma preference negative behavioral health impacts. Further, as summarized earlier, health impacts may exemplify wound and survival, trauma and resilience (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008).Illustrations of the Model Narratives of loss and resilience Historical trauma narratives do not always offer a clear path to either wounding or resilience, but instead may indicate both of these responses simultaneously. For example, among many indigenous groups around the world, the history of being colonized forms a common narrative that includes being displaced from traditional land and resources, physically and culturally slaughtered, and portrayed by the dominant culture as uncivilized and less evolved (Duran, 2006). This narrative presents a history of trauma, including disease, warfare, colonization, cultural genocide, and poverty, yet it is also a story of ongoing resistance (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011)—it is a history of devastation and survival. Native American reservations in the U.S. and the coerced resettlement of Inuit into government towns in Canada serve as powerful examples of how historical trauma narratives can simultaneously manifest a sense of loss and resilience. This history carries a legacy of imprisonment—with reservations and government settlements serving as ongoing symbols of confinement and loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Conversely, these communities are also sites of resilience, where indigenous peoples maintain traditional family structures and provide rich enculturation (Walters, Simoni, & Evans-Campbell, 2002). Thus, reservations and government settlements serve a dual function—as reminders of loss as well as places that sustain cultural identity and continuity. A similar narrative of loss and resilience is found in Abramowitz’s (2005) description of how the public narratives of communities in the Guinean Languette after attacks on their villages resulted in varying post-traumatic symptoms. Those villages that created narratives of group trauma that stressed community persistence and the survival\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ABORIGINAL RESERVATIONS<|>GEO<|>Aboriginal reservations are areas designated for Indigenous peoples, often associated with historical trauma and marginalization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECAYING URBAN ENVIRONMENTS<|>GEO<|>Decaying urban environments are areas in cities that have fallen into disrepair, often reflecting socio-economic challenges and historical neglect.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN SPORTS MASCOTS<|>EVENT<|>Native American sports mascots are symbols used in sports teams that often perpetuate stereotypes about Indigenous peoples.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological wounds experienced by a group due to historical events, such as colonization and discrimination.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>EVENT<|>Microaggressions are subtle, often unintentional, discriminatory comments or behaviors that convey negative messages to marginalized groups.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL GENOCIDE<|>EVENT<|>Cultural genocide involves the systematic destruction of a group's culture, including language, traditions, and identity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIGENOUS GROUPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Indigenous groups are communities of people who are the original inhabitants of a region, often facing historical oppression and marginalization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS<|>EVENT<|>Psychological distress is a mental health condition that can arise from experiences of trauma, discrimination, and social marginalization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEALTH DISPARITIES<|>EVENT<|>Health disparities refer to the differences in health outcomes and access to healthcare among different population groups, often linked to social and economic factors.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESILIENCE<|>EVENT<|>Resilience is the ability of individuals or communities to recover from adversity and maintain their cultural identity despite challenges.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABORIGINAL RESERVATIONS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Aboriginal reservations are often sites of historical trauma due to their association with colonization and loss of land<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DECAYING URBAN ENVIRONMENTS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Decaying urban environments can reflect the historical trauma experienced by marginalized communities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN SPORTS MASCOTS<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>Native American sports mascots can be seen as a form of microaggression against Indigenous peoples<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>INDIGENOUS GROUPS<|>Indigenous groups often experience historical trauma due to colonization and systemic discrimination<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROAGGRESSIONS<|>PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS<|>Microaggressions can lead to psychological distress among marginalized individuals<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL GENOCIDE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Cultural genocide is a significant aspect of historical trauma affecting Indigenous peoples<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEALTH DISPARITIES<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Health disparities are often linked to the historical trauma experienced by marginalized communities<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESILIENCE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Resilience is a response to historical trauma, showcasing the ability of communities to overcome adversity<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
