The changes are likely to result in lively debate for forensic mental health professionals in court testimony and policy debates. Intellectual Disability and Mental Retardation Although DSM-5 avoids using terminology that blurs the lines between clinical practice and the law, there are exceptions to this principle. In 2010, Rosa's Law18 replaced the term mental retardation with intellectual disability as a matter of U.S. federal law. In keeping with this change, DSM-5 has also replaced the diagnosis mental retardation with intellectual disability, and the nomenclature in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)19 is intellectual developmental disorder. In the text, the latter diagnosis is placed in parentheses and listed after the DSM-5 diagnosis, to facilitate the transition from DSM coding to the ICD-10 coding structure (Ref. 1, p 12). The term mental retardation has been widely considered stigmatizing, and the change in nomenclature marks a step forward in our awareness of and approach to understanding intellectual disability as a limitation that may be responsive, at times, to therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation. The elimination of the multiaxial diagnostic system in DSM-5 will also serve to lessen stigmatization, as it results in the removal of intellectual disorders diagnoses from Axis II, where they shared a somewhat stigmatizing position with the personality disorder diagnoses. DSM-5 specifiers for intellectual disability (mild, moderate, severe, and profound) have not changed from DSM-IV. DSM-5 provides a table and examples of deficits listed in three domains of adaptive functioning: conceptual (academic), social, and practical. These domains all have implications for forensic evaluators. For example, adults with mild intellectual disability may have conceptual deficits in abstract reasoning, managing money, executive functioning, and short-term memory. They may have a limited capacity to appreciate risk in social situations and may be more gullible than their same-age peers. They may also need help with practical skills, such as making health care and legal decisions and performing a skilled job competently. DSM-5 stresses the importance of norming tests to account for cultural variances and an examinee's native language. This may be an important consideration for forensic psychiatrists who consult in cases involving immigrants where a diagnosis of intellectual disability is being considered or applied, such as a disability claim or a petition for a workplace accommodation. Some individuals may malinger intellectual disability disorder to avoid legal consequences. It may be more challenging to detect malingering in an individual who is from a culture or who speaks a language with which the forensic mental health professional is not familiar. DSM-5 also describes the circumstances under which a child who has been diagnosed with intellectual disability benefits from interventions that significantly improve adaptive functioning, “such that the diagnosis of Intellectual Disability is no longer appropriate” (Ref. 1, p 39). At times, this change will result in lively debate among forensic mental health professionals in courtrooms and elsewhere, especially when intellectual disability disorder is tendered as a basis for adjudicative incompetence or a bar to capital sentencing. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court determined in Atkins v. Virginia20 that individuals with mental retardation cannot be executed. In that case, the condition was vaguely described as intellectual functioning in the subaverage range: roughly below IQ 70 and deficits in social and practical functioning with an onset before age 18.21 New definitions of intellectual disability in DSM-5 may provide guidance as mental health experts and the Supreme Court grapple with this difficult forensic matter. The clinical validity of intellectual disability disorder may also be debated by forensic mental health experts when an individual seems to meet diagnostic criteria in the absence of supporting documentation from the neurodevelopmental period. The absence of such information is particularly important when forensic psychiatrists evaluate institutionalized adults who demonstrate obvious intellectual impairment and deficits in adaptive functioning and who lack supporting educational and medical documentation to affirm the diagnosis. DSM-5's emphasis on clinical impression and adaptive functioning in the diagnosis of intellectual disability disorder is likely to increase forensic psychiatry's role in courtroom testimony regarding affected and allegedly affected individuals. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: A New Childhood Disorder One of the most significant additions to DSM-5 diagnoses is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new mood disorder classified in the depressive disorders section but exclusive to children and adolescents. This disorder may be identified in individuals who have persistent irritability or anger and recurrent episodes (on average three times per week) of developmentally inappropriate verbal or behavioral dyscontrol. The symptoms start before age 10 years, the diagnosis is made between ages 6 and 18, and the disorder causes significant impairment. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was introduced due to “considerable concern” (Ref. 1, p 157) that some children with this symptom profile are overdiagnosed with and treated for bipolar disorder. However, researchers who study bipolar disorder in children and adolescents found that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder could not be distinguished from oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder and lacked substantial diagnostic stability.17,22 In addition, some in the research community questioned the diagnostic utility of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in clinical populations.22,23 The initial diagnostic criteria proposed for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder were revised, perhaps in response to these concerns, to improve the utility and validity of the diagnosis. The resultant criteria more clearly distinguished disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder. Individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have persistent symptoms, whereas youths with bipolar disorder have discrete episodes of mania or hypomania. In other words, the duration of mood symptoms is the benchmark that distinguishes the two disorders.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which provides guidelines for diagnosing mental health conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATKINS V.
