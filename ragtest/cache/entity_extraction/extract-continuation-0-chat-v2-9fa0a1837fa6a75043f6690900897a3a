For example, the birth of a child may be interpreted as leading to increased stress and social isolation, especially when past trauma experiences are associated with related stressors. For others, the aftermath of trauma leads to a narrative of cognitive transformation or redemption in which a negative life experience is later viewed in positive terms, often after a period of personal struggle (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004). For example, one may see benefit in becoming more self-reliant after the death of a parent so as to result in a positive reinterpretation of the event’s aftermath, despite the pain caused by the loss. In contrast to contamination narratives, redemption and cognitive transformation narratives are positively associated with well-being and resilience (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004). Such personal narratives are contextualized within public narratives that inform how adversity is viewed within the broader culture or by a specific cultural group (Pals & McAdams, 2004). Public narratives may frame how post-traumatic growth, as one example, is even possible within a given socio-cultural context (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004). Affiliation with group identity and knowledge of the narratives of that group can be a source of resilience for marginalized groups. For example, for indigenous youth and sexual minority youth, group affiliation can encourage a sense of participation in a political struggle evidencing collective strength (Wexler et al., 2009). Resilience in response to adversity and trauma is, in this way, a process in negotiation with influential public narratives such as those conveying group histories of trauma and survival. Just as individuals express resilience through narratives of transformation following traumatic events (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004), so too do groups and communities represent group resilience in narratives of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008; Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) illustrates this effectively by tracing how narrative frames family identity and resilience strategies through four generations of an American Indian family. Family and public narratives, hence, influence the formation of personal narratives, the interpretation of one’s contexts, and the response to personal and collective traumas. Psychological well-being is related to one’s ability to process narratives and form coherent life stories and interpretations (Pals, 2006; Ville & Khlat, 2006). For example, the ability to develop autobiographical coherence linking one’s sense of self to the past and future, referred to as self-continuity, is predictive of suicide risk (Chandler, 1994). Like self-continuity, Chandler and Lalonde (2009) have shown how cultural-continuity—the degree to which a community engages in actions symbolic of their sense of community as a cultural group—functions as a protective factor and moderator of behavioral health problems among some indigenous Canadian communities. Historical trauma that results from colonization may lead to diminished cultural continuity, which may lead to limited collective action to preserve and advance a cultural legacy (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009). Conversely, narratives of continuity and cultural revitalization promote resiliency (Kirmayer, Dandeneau, Marshall, Phillips, & Williamson, 2011). Strong cultural identity may be emblematic of public resilience in the face of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013). For example, Taylor and Usborne (2010) argue that reconstruction of a strong cultural identity following collective trauma, such as war or disaster, is critical in subsequent individual and community well-being. Their research has shown that clarity in one’s cultural identity predicts personal well-being and that clarity in one’s self-concept mediates this relationship across diverse cultures (Usborne & Taylor, 2010). Furthermore, cultural identity represents the interaction between public norms and self-concept readily expressed in narratives (Gone, Miller, & Rappaport, 1999). International research demonstrates that, across many cultures, family and community narratives contextualize an intergenerational self-concept that serves an important protective role, such as for adolescents (Fivush, Habermas, Waters, & Zaman, 2011) or among marginalized groups who may face daily discrimination (Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) and Crawford (2013) both emphasize how for indigenous people in North America family narratives of historical trauma play a central role in how children situate themselves with respect to adversity and resilience.A Narrative Model for Understanding the Impact of Historical Trauma on Health Figure 1 presents a narrative model that specifies how public narratives of historical trauma impact health. As shown, the model specifies successive recursive stages beginning with public narratives of historical trauma that frame contemporary reminders of past collective trauma for a particular group or community. These contemporary reminders influence how salient the narrative is to a person or group; conversely, the salience of the narrative to the individual is critical in determining whether an experience will be interpreted as a reminder of historical trauma(s) or not. Narrative salience also influences whether the narrative will have health implications. Similarly, health status influences the salience of historical trauma narratives; for example, if a person struggles with health outcomes that are attributed to a public narrative of historical trauma, then that narrative is more likely to be seen as relevant to one’s life. Our narrative model of historical trauma is heuristic in that it emphasizes the possible recursive influences between historical trauma narratives, contemporary reminders of that trauma, narrative salience of the trauma within personal and public contexts, and health impacts. We provide a brief description of each component of the model below. Figure 1.
