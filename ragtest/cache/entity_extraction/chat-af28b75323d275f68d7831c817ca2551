This overlap can sometimes delay accurate diagnosis or treatment, as healthcare professionals may focus on the more visible symptoms without recognizing the underlying trauma. Therefore, understanding the impact of ACEs is crucial for developing effective mental health treatment plans that address the root causes of these disorders.\nFor example, a study published in Psychology Today highlights how symptoms of depression and anxiety often overlap with behavioral patterns seen in survivors of chronic childhood trauma.

This dysregulation can lead to long-term exposure to stress hormones, which in turn contributes to a myriad of chronic health conditions.
