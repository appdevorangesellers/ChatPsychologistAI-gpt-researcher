In CPTSD, emotion regulation involves difficulty self-calming when distressed and chronic emotional numbing.\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)\nThis childhood condition can involve experiencing extreme moods and intense temper outbursts. There is often a lot of anger with this condition, irritability, and strong behaviors in response to negative emotions.\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)\nPoor emotional regulation is a common symptom of autism. Individuals often have greater or more intense baseline levels of negative emotions or irritability, have poorer problem-solving skills, can become easily overstimulated, and may find it harder to detect other people’s emotions.\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nPoor emotional regulation is a key symptom of ADHD. Individuals with this disorder may have strong reactions to small setbacks, feel their emotions more intensely than others, have difficulty calming down, and have a low tolerance for frustration or annoyance.\nThe cycle of distress\nWanting to minimize or avoid strong and negative emotions is part of what is often called a ‘cycle of shame.’ This pattern often looks like the Experimental Avoidance Model by Chapman, Gratz, & Brown (2006).\nThis model explains that self-harm is primarily maintained by negative reinforcement in the form of escape or avoidance of unwanted emotional experiences.\nThis effectively levels out the rollercoaster of emotions until the next time. This can be applied to any unhelpful coping strategy that people use instead of regulating their emotions.\nWhen people use these unhelpful strategies, they do not feel good about using them despite their short-term effectiveness. These tend to add to a larger sense of shame or failure that sets the stage for the whole process to begin again. This is how it can become a vicious cycle.\nBreaking the distress cycle\nChanging any part of the cycle can interfere with the pattern and lead to more positive thoughts and feelings.\nTechniques such as those employed in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you learn how to understand and work with the relationship between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\nLearn to pay attention to the way the thought-emotion-behavior relationship works for you, then ask yourself some questions:\nWhat particular ideas or thought patterns are causing a reaction in your mind?\nWhich emotions do you find most difficult to endure or handle?\nWhat methods or actions do you take to ease your anxiety?\nTo what extent do these techniques provide relief in both immediate and long-term situations?\nAre there any fundamental convictions you hold about yourself, others, or the world that have a bearing on the negative spiral?\nAlternatively, what are the thoughts and convictions that contribute the most to generating positive emotions for you?\nIt is important to note that there can be a variety of strategies that are used to deal with emotions, even overwhelming ones.\nWhat happens most often is that these strategies are not applied flexibly, and someone may use the same unhelpful strategy in every negative situation.\nPutting effort into questioning what thoughts you have and what coping strategies you gravitate towards is an essential step toward ending the distress cycle.\nSkills for regulating emotions\nLearning emotion regulation skills will help us learn to effectively manage and change the way we feel and cope with situations.\n1. Name the emotion\nAttempting to avoid unpleasant thoughts and feelings can actually result in more unwanted negative thoughts and feelings.\nRather than avoiding unpleasant emotions, acknowledge their presence and name them specifically. It can be helpful to say out loud or think to yourself, ‘I am feeling sad/angry/afraid.\nIf you are uncertain about what emotion you are feeling, you can use a ‘Feelings Wheel,’ which displays many of the primary and secondary emotions one may feel.\nNaming the emotion often leads to the emotion losing its power. It can allow us to let go of some of the pain and discomfort that accompany the unpleasant emotion.\n2. Recognize and understand the emotion\nIt makes sense to believe that people who are unclear about their emotions are also less aware and less clear about their psychological needs.\nA way in which you can become more aware of what you are feeling is to pay attention to what you are experiencing physiologically in your body.\nFor instance, you may have an unsettled feeling in your stomach when feeling anxious, or you may feel a tightness in your chest if you are feeling sad.\n3. Validate the emotion\nIt is key to recognize that your emotions are present for a valid reason and that they are telling you something.\nPractice self-compassion and give yourself support for the unpleasant emotions you are experiencing. Understand that feeling strong negative emotions are a normal part of life.\nTry to breathe into the experience of your emotions. You can soothe hurt feelings by placing a hand over your body where you feel this experience, then breathe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition characterized by emotional sensitivity and unstable moods, often leading to difficulties in emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPLEX POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) is a condition that arises from prolonged exposure to trauma, leading to difficulties in emotion regulation and self-calming.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISRUPTIVE MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a childhood condition marked by extreme mood swings and temper outbursts, often associated with poor emotional regulation.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that often includes symptoms of poor emotional regulation and heightened emotional responses.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition characterized by difficulties in maintaining attention and emotional regulation, often leading to intense emotional reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>EVENT<|>Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and the emotions of others, which is crucial for effective communication and conflict resolution.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a therapeutic approach that helps individuals understand and change their thought patterns and behaviors related to emotions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>Individuals with borderline personality disorder often exhibit low emotional intelligence, leading to difficulties in emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPLEX POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>CPTSD can result in reduced emotional intelligence, making it challenging for individuals to manage their emotions effectively.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DISRUPTIVE MOOD DYSREGULATION DISORDER<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>DMDD is associated with low emotional intelligence, which contributes to extreme mood swings and difficulty in emotional expression.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often struggle with emotional intelligence, affecting their ability to recognize and respond to emotions.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>ADHD is linked to low emotional intelligence, which can lead to strong emotional reactions and difficulties in emotional regulation.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE<|>COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY<|>Cognitive behavioral therapy can enhance emotional intelligence by teaching individuals how to understand and manage their emotions effectively.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
