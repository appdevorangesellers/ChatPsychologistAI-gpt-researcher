Trauma survivors often face lifelong challenges in developing and maintaining trusting relationships; building and utilizing healthy coping strategies; and adjusting to school and, eventually, the workplace (12–14). For example, ACEs positively predict PTSD, recurrent depression, and repeated suicide attempts (15–17), and findings from several meta-analyses consistently link ACEs to enduring and debilitating psychiatric and physical health disorders (1, 18). It has been suggested that individuals who have experienced ACEs often view the world as unfair and to blame for their circumstances, resulting in reoccurring helplessness and hopelessness about life and relationships, including their ability to make a positive and meaningful impact. Indeed, retrospective studies with adults reveal that 50–60% of adults have a history of childhood abuse or neglect that has impacted their emotional development, their core assumptions about themselves and their worlds, and their functioning as adults (19, 20). Children and PTSD Research suggests that children and adolescents who experienced significant early interpersonal trauma often receive inaccurate or incomplete diagnoses later in life [thereby leading to various treatments for co-occurring psychiatric disorders that may not be effective; (21, 22)]. Scholars spanning a broad range of scientific disciplines have asserted that this is due to significant limitations in the DSM's PTSD classification system (23–28). Repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents share overlapping symptoms of PTSD; however, experiences of prolonged trauma during sensitive periods of development are more detrimental to children, given their age, limited cognitive capacities, and dependency on caregivers. A new conceptualization of trauma—specifically the construct of complex trauma—was developed for repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents who often have high comorbidities between trauma and other disorders, which are underestimated by PTSD diagnostic criteria (29–31). From this perspective, the diagnosis of PTSD only accounts for a limited portion of the symptoms experienced by individuals who have experienced childhood trauma. These individuals often demonstrate broader and more severe health problems, social and economic adversity (including poverty and homelessness, psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration), and medical and psychiatric comorbidities as well as persistent negative views of themselves, others, and their life circumstances (32–34). In addition, they may re-enact their traumas through defensive (protective) expressions of anger and aggression (because they fear emotional vulnerability and experiencing additional traumas) and by coping with alcohol, drugs, and self-inflicted injuries to numb their emotional pain and suffering (35). The differing presentations of trauma-related disorders that span a wide range of medical and psychological comorbidities frequently go unnoticed with classical PTSD diagnostic approaches, and, therefore, are often underreported and, in turn, untreated (36). Individuals who have experienced prolonged, repeated interpersonal traumas often present with overlapping symptoms of PTSD and a multiplicity of mental health conditions such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD, including late-onset in adulthood), autism spectrum disorders (ASD, including social-communication disturbances), psychosis, and mood and personality disorders (37–42).Complex post-traumatic stress disorder The conceptualization of complex trauma emphasizes prolonged and unavoidable circumstances, regardless of one's age. Compared to those with PTSD, patients with complex PTSD (c-PTSD) consistently report cumulative traumas, including interpersonal violence exposure and sexual abuse (30, 43–50). c-PTSD has been studied extensively in diverse samples, including racial and sexual minorities as well as human trafficking victims who have experienced repeated physical and sexual assault (51–54). Nevertheless, more studies of children with c-PTSD are needed [i.e., (55)]. Adolescents and adults who have experienced trauma and developed measurable mental health symptoms, as a result, may present with indications of c-PTSD that warrant careful diagnostic evaluation. As defined by ICD-11 criteria, the symptoms of c-PTSD are characterized by three PTSD symptom clusters: (1) persistent and intrusive thoughts, (2) hyperarousal (i.e., heightened startle in response to unexpected sounds or movements), and (3) deliberate avoidance of trauma reminders. c-PTSD is differentiated by a second higher-order measurement factor, characterized by disturbances in self-organization (DSO), which encompasses affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and pervasive disturbances in relationships (56–58). DSO is also highly prevalent in patients with borderline personality disorder [BPD; (59)]. More specifically, c-PTSD and BPD have overlapping symptoms of anxiety sensitivity, low psychological distress tolerance, dissociation, and relational problems originating from attachment insecurities and, in clinical contexts, parataxic distortions whereby patients re-enact interpersonal behaviors with healthcare providers that mirror past relationships (60–63). However, empirical findings suggest that BPD only accounts for a limited portion of the symptoms reported by individuals who have experienced childhood trauma and that characteristics of c-PTSD and BPD correlate with, and are distinct from, several other psychiatric disorders such as unipolar and bipolar depression, substance abuse, and functional neurological disorders [e.g., (59, 64–68)].Developmental trauma: An overview Developmental Trauma (DT) refers to the complex and pervasive exposure to life-threatening events that (1) occurs through sensitive periods of infant and child development, (2) disrupts interpersonal attachments, (3) compromises an individual's safety and security operations, (4) alters foundational capacities for cognitive, behavioral, and emotional control, and (5) often contributes to the development of complex PTSD in adulthood (69–74). DTD emerges from prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma that disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers and dramatically alters core assumptions and beliefs about one's vulnerability to danger in the world. DTD is theorized to develop from early interpersonal trauma. However, DTD\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
