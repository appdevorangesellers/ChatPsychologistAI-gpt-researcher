The diagnostic criteria will facilitate identification of aggressive youths who may benefit from evidence-based clinical interventions for PTSD. This is particularly important in Latino, Native American, and African American youths, who have higher rates of PTSD, even after adjusting for demographic factors and exposure to trauma (Ref. 1, p 276). These youths also are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system. However, cultural sensitivity is a requirement when diagnosing PTSD, especially when a forensic psychiatrist is evaluating a child from another country where he may have been exposed to various traumas and is struggling to acculturate. The changes in the PTSD diagnostic criteria may increase the likelihood that child forensic psychiatrists will be asked to testify about PTSD and aggression in school, special education, individualized education programs (IEPs), and expulsion hearings and in juvenile court waiver or bindover and disposition or sentencing hearings. When youths who have been exposed to severe trauma engage in aggressive, risky, or thrill-seeking behavior and appear to be callous and unemotional, judicial administrators may want to know whether the history of traumatization is contributing to the behavior and warrants mental health intervention. Child forensic psychiatrists may be increasingly retained to examine this question and to recommend therapeutic interventions for affected individuals. Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Conduct disorder is one of the only diagnoses in the DSM-5 that contains no exclusionary criteria for other clinically treatable diagnoses, and consequently, it may lend itself to diagnosis by lay persons who lack facility with clinical diagnoses. The diagnosis, which can also be made in adults, requires the affected individual to meet 3 of 15 criteria in one of four categories: aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violation of rules. One specifier, with limited prosocial emotions, merits further discussion. Individuals with limited prosocial emotions meet two of the following four criteria: lack of remorse or guilt about their behavior until they are caught; lack of empathy; seeming unconcerned about consequences of unsatisfactory academic, professional, or other achievement; and “shallow or deficient affect” (Ref. 1, p 471). These youths often misuse substances and have a higher rate of suicidal ideation and attempted and completed suicides (Ref. 1, p 473). The behavioral description of conduct disorder overlaps considerably with the behavior exhibited by individuals with psychosis, mood disorders, and PTSD. Also, many youths with conduct disorder become involved in the juvenile justice system, where the prevalence of mental disorders is higher than in the general population, even when conduct disorder is excluded.26 Perception of the limited prosocial emotions specifier has not been studied in juvenile court judges. However, when conduct disorder with callous and unemotional features was studied in mental health professionals who evaluate justice-involved youths, the response was both negative and punitive. This outcome has led to concerns about the influence of this specifier on mental health professionals and on the jurists and attorneys to whom they provide expert consultation.27 The facility with which the conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions diagnosis can be made increases the likelihood that other treatable diagnoses may be overlooked, as often happens when mental health services in juvenile corrections facilities are reviewed.28,29 The concern extends to youths charged with more serious offenses, whose cases are bound over or waived from juvenile to criminal court. These individuals tend to have more serious mental disorders than youths whose cases remain in the juvenile court system.30 Although defense attorneys have concerns about the adjudicative competence of youths who seem to lack the maturity to understand the legal process and to assist in their defense,31 immaturity is not considered a mental disease or defect for purposes of adjudicative incompetence.32 Juveniles also are more likely than adults to make false confessions.33 Consequently, in the United States, a youth with conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions may be adjudicated delinquent or bound over, even if he does not understand the legal process and has treatable mental disorders that have been overlooked. Although youths should not be absolved of responsibility for their actions, those with treatable mental disorders should not be overlooked, but rather should be placed in juvenile and other settings that foster mental health rehabilitation. For example, DSM-5 indicates that “individuals with conduct disorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders and substance-related disorders as adults” (Ref. 1, p 473). Nevertheless, in the discussion accompanying the diagnosis, the prevalence of these evolving mental disorders in children and adolescents is not discussed, and an opportunity to alert diagnosticians to the need for early identification of and interventions for affected individuals is missed. Conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions represents a defined condition that may alter the trajectory of the lives of youths who have undiagnosed but more treatable comorbid disorders. The absence of exclusionary criteria illuminates the dangers associated with using DSM-5 inappropriately in forensic settings. It also suggests that, in rare cases, it may unintentionally contribute to adverse outcomes, even when it is used for its intended purpose. DSM-5 and Legal Practice Although there are many changes in DSM-5 that may enhance how mental disorders are classified and studied, one thing has not changed: the danger of legal professionals, policy makers, and others using The Manual to advance legal, political, and nonmedical agendas. It is important, therefore, for child forensic psychiatrists to be familiar with the “Cautionary Statement\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PTSD<|>EVENT<|>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, characterized by symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATINO YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>Latino youths are individuals from Latino backgrounds who may experience higher rates of PTSD due to various traumas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>Native American youths are individuals from Native American backgrounds who may experience higher rates of PTSD due to various traumas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>PERSON<|>African American youths are individuals from African American backgrounds who may experience higher rates of PTSD due to various traumas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The juvenile justice system is a legal framework designed to handle minors who have been accused of committing crimes, often focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association that classifies mental disorders and outlines diagnostic criteria.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>PERSON<|>Child forensic psychiatrists are medical professionals who specialize in the intersection of mental health and the legal system, particularly concerning children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Conduct disorder is a mental health diagnosis characterized by a pattern of disruptive and violent behavior, often leading to difficulties in social, academic, and legal settings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIMITED PROSOCIAL EMOTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Limited prosocial emotions is a specifier for conduct disorder that indicates a lack of empathy, remorse, or concern for others.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LATINO YOUTHS<|>PTSD<|>Latino youths are identified as having higher rates of PTSD, indicating a direct relationship between their demographic and the mental health condition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>PTSD<|>Native American youths are identified as having higher rates of PTSD, indicating a direct relationship between their demographic and the mental health condition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>PTSD<|>African American youths are identified as having higher rates of PTSD, indicating a direct relationship between their demographic and the mental health condition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>LATINO YOUTHS<|>Latino youths are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, indicating a relationship between their demographic and the system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>Native American youths are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, indicating a relationship between their demographic and the system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS<|>African American youths are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice system, indicating a relationship between their demographic and the system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 provides diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder, indicating a relationship between the manual and the mental health condition<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>PTSD<|>Child forensic psychiatrists may be asked to evaluate PTSD in youths, indicating a relationship between their profession and the mental health condition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILD FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>Child forensic psychiatrists may evaluate conduct disorder in youths, indicating a relationship between their profession and the mental health condition<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONDUCT DISORDER<|>LIMITED PROSOCIAL EMOTIONS<|>Limited prosocial emotions is a specifier for conduct disorder, indicating a direct relationship between the two<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
