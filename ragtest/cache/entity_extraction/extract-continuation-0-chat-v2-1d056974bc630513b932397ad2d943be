Researchers speculate that the mechanisms involved in the development of traumatic stress adaptations correlate with diverse, interrelated psychiatric symptoms and comorbidities often reported in studies of individuals who have experienced repeated abuse and neglect. This notion is consistent with a socio-ecological framework, the developmental trauma diagnosis, and trans-theoretical models that focus on far-reaching (cross-diagnostic) effects from critical and sensitive periods, attachment and social cognition (e.g., mentalizing and perspective taking), sleep, physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and mood and personality (141–143). The role of attachment Prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers. According to attachment theorists, securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregivers to minimize anxiety and to form goal-directed partnerships, and/or interactional synchrony, where they mirror each other's communication patterns and learn to anticipate, express, and meet each other's needs. Through these interactions, children develop internal working models, which encompass individuals' core beliefs about their self-worth and lovability as well as their general expectations of others in relationships (144). Insecure attachment styles (e.g., anxious, avoidant, and disorganized) are frequently associated with interpersonal trauma (145–147). Studies have consistently linked attachment disturbances to the emergence (and maintenance) of developmental trauma symptoms, which may remain latent until interpersonal interactions later in life (e.g., peer conflicts, inadequate institutional responses to trauma, workplace challenges) give rise to memories of early trauma (148). The combination of repeated childhood trauma and the absence of parental nurturing, support, and protection (e.g., parents who are addicted to alcohol and/or drugs, are homeless, or are living in severe poverty; family violence; parental incarceration) can be particularly devastating and can potentiate DT (34, 145, 149, 150).Social cognition Cognitive science researchers have expanded upon attachment concepts to include the construct of mentalizing, which is defined as the capacity to consider the mental states of others (e.g., inferring their needs, goals, interests, and intersubjective experiences) as distinct from one's own. Mentalizing has been described in the literature as reflective functioning, theory of mind, metacognition, insight, and perspective-taking (151). Mentalizing deficits have been reported in several clinical populations, including individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and more recently, developmental traumas (152–155). Children and adolescents with DT demonstrate impaired mentalizing (i.e., reflecting functioning), referring to the capacity to effectively understand oneself (needs, strengths, and limitations) and others (e.g., that others may have worldviews that differ from one's own). Early interpersonal trauma and insecure attachment correlate with low reflective functioning (154, 156–158). Scholars have surmised that these children are likely dissociating (and therefore undermining their intra/interpersonal awareness), fearful and anxious, and preoccupied with maintaining compulsive and highly ritualistic behaviors (41, 159). For example, in response to sexual trauma, victims often report experiencing contamination anxiety such as body shame and disgust and overwhelming fear, that being near others will result in contact contamination (160–162). These individuals, in turn, engage in social avoidance, excessive cleansing, handwashing, and relentless reassurance-seeking to make sure they don't increase the likelihood of illness or misfortune in others.Executive functions and self-regulation capacities Executive functions refer to diverse cognitive abilities including working memory, mental flexibility, and information processing that regulate attention, mood, and behavior; enable adaptive, goal-focused actions; and are instrumental to effective coping, problem solving, and success in school, work, and relationships (163). Traumatic stress is known to cause measurable adverse effects on executive functions (121, 134, 164). For example, recent studies, including several meta-analyses, have found that trauma negatively correlates with working memory, inhibition, and mental flexibility; the adverse effects are often higher for children exposed to multiple traumas compared to those reporting isolated events (93, 165, 166). These executive functioning challenges often result in significant shifts in mood and energy that interfere with concentration, decision-making, and social-interpersonal functioning. Children and adolescents with symptoms consistent with DTD whose symptoms include reckless, disinhibited, and destructive behaviors are likely to have multiple and intersecting psychiatric disturbances, such as conduct disorder and antisocial personality traits, which are known to predict high incarceration rates and recidivism. In turn, these children may grow up feeling stigmatized, unprotected, and personally flawed, which further perpetuates their depression, anger, low self-esteem, and existential despair as well as their increased risk of learning disorders, vocational problems, and criminal records (12, 13, 167, 168).Clinical assessment Patients with DT present with signs of mood disturbances (e.g., poor frustration tolerance, emotional numbing, anger, rage), behavior disturbances (e.g., inflexible routines, self-injurious behaviors, impulsivity), and cognitive disturbances (e.g., inattention, disorganized thinking, poor problem solving), as well as sensory processing problems such as sensitivity to sound and touch as well as limited time and body awareness (169, 170). They often show signs of a heightened startle reflex, dissociation, fear, and anxiety and are often unable to be soothed by others (171–173). For example, studies of children who have experienced trauma and polyvictimization suggest that these children display greater physiological reactivity to threats such as traumatic reminders than children who have not experienced trauma (174–177). Clinical signs and symptoms of DTD Children and adolescents with DTD may react with either over-modulated or under-modulated behaviors. Over-modulated children appear hyperactive and aggressive, whereas under-modulated children appear depressed, withdrawn, and possibly dissociative.
