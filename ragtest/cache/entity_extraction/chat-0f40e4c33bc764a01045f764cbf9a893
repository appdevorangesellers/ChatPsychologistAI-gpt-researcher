Children with these disorders require significant additional support from families and educational systems; the disorders frequently persist into adulthood (Nevo and Manassis 2009; Polanczyk and Rohde 2007; Shaw and others 2012). These children are more likely to experience a compromised developmental trajectory, with increased need for medical and disability services, as well as increased risk of contact with law enforcement agencies (Fergusson, Horwood, and Lynskey 1993).Childhood Mental and Behavioral DisordersThis chapter limits the discussion to the following five conditions: childhood anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, autism, and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive or inappropriate fear, with associated behavioral disturbances that impair functioning (APA 2013). Children with anxiety disorders have clinical symptoms, such as excessive anxiety; severe physiological anxiety symptoms; behavioral disturbances, such as avoidance of feared objects; and associated distress or impairment (Beesdo, Knappe, and Pine 2009).ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention and disorganization, with or without hyperactivity-impulsivity, causing impairment of functioning (APA 2013). ADHD persists into adulthood in approximately 20 percent of individuals (Polanczyk and Rohde 2007).Conduct disorder diagnosed in children under the age of 18 years is characterized by a pattern of antisocial behaviors that violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms.Autism is a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
