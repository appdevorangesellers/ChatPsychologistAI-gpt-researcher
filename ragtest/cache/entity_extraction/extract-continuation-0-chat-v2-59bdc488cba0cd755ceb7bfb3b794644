Further, as summarized earlier, health impacts may exemplify wound and survival, trauma and resilience (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008).Illustrations of the Model Narratives of loss and resilience Historical trauma narratives do not always offer a clear path to either wounding or resilience, but instead may indicate both of these responses simultaneously. For example, among many indigenous groups around the world, the history of being colonized forms a common narrative that includes being displaced from traditional land and resources, physically and culturally slaughtered, and portrayed by the dominant culture as uncivilized and less evolved (Duran, 2006). This narrative presents a history of trauma, including disease, warfare, colonization, cultural genocide, and poverty, yet it is also a story of ongoing resistance (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011)—it is a history of devastation and survival. Native American reservations in the U.S. and the coerced resettlement of Inuit into government towns in Canada serve as powerful examples of how historical trauma narratives can simultaneously manifest a sense of loss and resilience. This history carries a legacy of imprisonment—with reservations and government settlements serving as ongoing symbols of confinement and loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). Conversely, these communities are also sites of resilience, where indigenous peoples maintain traditional family structures and provide rich enculturation (Walters, Simoni, & Evans-Campbell, 2002). Thus, reservations and government settlements serve a dual function—as reminders of loss as well as places that sustain cultural identity and continuity. A similar narrative of loss and resilience is found in Abramowitz’s (2005) description of how the public narratives of communities in the Guinean Languette after attacks on their villages resulted in varying post-traumatic symptoms. Those villages that created narratives of group trauma that stressed community persistence and the survival of cultural systems had lower rates of post-traumatic symptoms; in contrast, villages with public narratives that emphasized the destruction of the community’s local moral world exhibited higher post-conflict symptoms (Abramowitz, 2005). This example also illustrates two related observations about narratives of loss and resilience: 1) how the wide variation in public narratives about trauma may result in markedly varying health impacts, and 2) how varying health impacts may be observed despite common traumatic experiences. Examples of public narratives emblematic of loss and resilience are also evident in the experiences of other historically oppressed cultural groups, including descendants of the Armenian genocide during the Ottoman Empire, descendants of Stalinist persecution in Russian, African American, and aboriginal or indigenous peoples across the world. It is not uncommon for these narratives to include experiences of genocide, forced relocation, enslavement, and ongoing discrimination and marginalization; often alongside narratives of resistance, survival, hope, and resilience (Baker & Gippenreiter, 1998; Evans-Campbell, 2008; Fullilove, 2005; Karenian et al., 2011; Kienzler, 2008; Pollack, 2003; Wexler et al., 2009).Historical trauma narratives response to disaster Although historical trauma has mostly been developed to explain the experiences of historically marginalized ethnic groups, the construct is also relevant to understanding individual and community health for groups who have experienced a natural disaster. As Cox and Perry (2011) note in describing how a large wildfire in British Columbia fundamentally altered the community psyche of the two towns most damaged by the fire, place-based traumas also engender public narratives that can impact health. Cox and Perry (2011) show how narratives portraying positive outcomes, such as strengthened sense of community, as well as negative ones, such as feelings of anxiety towards the stability and safety of place, were evident following this disaster. They also show how each of these narratives were related to people’s sense of place. In another example, Long and Wong (2012) describe how the tension between national and local sense of recovery time following the Wenchuan earthquake in China exacerbated a sense of communal trauma. Instead of allowing community members to recover from this disaster at a pace that accommodated their personal and public narratives, members were deluged with national support and public expectations for a speedy recovery that conflicted with these narratives, thus increasing negative health impacts following the disaster. Although these examples are not intergenerational, they illustrate how a place-based trauma can remain part of a community’s cultural identity through a prevailing public narrative of loss or resilience. Place-based historical trauma narratives can also encode resilience, as is evident by public responses to the great Chicago fire of 1871, which decimated the new city but fostered an altered public identity for its surviving residents and subsequent generations. Many Chicagoans take pride in referring to Chicago as “the second city” because it depicts how the city was rebuilt using brick (rather than wood) following the great fire, how it “[rose] from [its] ashes, a greater city than before” (Shaw, 1921, p. 177). Not only is the narrative one of resilience and thriving, but the mostly brick buildings throughout Chicago serve as a contemporary reminder that heightens the narrative salience of “the second city” and the resilience of its inhabitants. As Pollack (2003) notes based on his research in Bosnia-Herzegovina, mass trauma experiences can damage people’s relationships to place, but social acts and symbols that re-narrate the connection between physical and social environments can counteract the negative consequences of trauma. Regardless of whether the past traumas are felt based on place, ethnicity, or other social, cultural, or contextual groupings, the public narratives created in response to trauma influence one’s sense of identity.Conclusion History provides a narrative context within\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the psychological and emotional effects experienced by groups due to historical events such as colonization, genocide, and forced relocation, impacting their health and identity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS<|>GEO<|>Native American reservations in the U.S. are areas designated for indigenous peoples, serving as both symbols of confinement and sites of cultural resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INUIT<|>PERSON<|>Inuit are indigenous peoples of Canada who have experienced coerced resettlement into government towns, impacting their cultural identity and health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>GEO<|>The Guinean Languette is a region where communities have experienced trauma from attacks, leading to varying health impacts based on their public narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>EVENT<|>The Armenian genocide refers to the mass extermination of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire, leading to historical trauma for descendants.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>EVENT<|>Stalinist persecution involved the oppression and suffering of various ethnic groups in Russia, contributing to their historical trauma narratives.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>PERSON<|>African Americans have a history of oppression, including slavery and discrimination, which shapes their narratives of resilience and survival.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO FIRE<|>EVENT<|>The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was a devastating event that destroyed much of the city but also fostered a narrative of resilience and rebuilding among its residents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE<|>EVENT<|>The Wenchuan earthquake in China caused significant destruction and trauma, affecting the community's recovery narratives and health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>CONCEPT<|>Cultural identity refers to the shared characteristics and narratives that define a group, often influenced by historical trauma and resilience.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Native American reservations are a direct result of historical trauma, representing both loss and resilience for indigenous peoples<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INUIT<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Inuit have experienced historical trauma through coerced resettlement, impacting their cultural identity and health<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUINEAN LANGUETTE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Guinean Languette communities' narratives of trauma and resilience illustrate the impact of historical trauma on health<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Armenian genocide has created a historical trauma narrative for descendants, affecting their cultural identity<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STALINIST PERSECUTION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Stalinist persecution has led to historical trauma narratives among affected ethnic groups, influencing their identity<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AFRICAN AMERICAN<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The historical trauma experienced by African Americans shapes their narratives of resilience and survival<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICAGO FIRE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Great Chicago Fire serves as a historical trauma that transformed the city's identity and narrative of resilience<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Wenchuan earthquake created a historical trauma narrative that affected community recovery and identity<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
