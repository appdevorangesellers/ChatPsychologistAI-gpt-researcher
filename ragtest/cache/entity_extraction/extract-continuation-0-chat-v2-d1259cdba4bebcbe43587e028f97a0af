It is important, therefore, for child forensic psychiatrists to be familiar with the “Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” (Ref. 1, p 25). DSM-5 is not intended for legal use. Legal professionals who use the text to address matters pertaining to children and adolescents risk misinterpreting or misusing the information. The child and adolescent forensic mental health professional who is cognizant of the “imperfect fit between legal questions to be addressed and questions of ultimate concern to the law” (Ref. 1, p 25) is in an excellent position to remind legal professionals of the drawbacks associated with using the DSM-5 in resolving legal questions. Conclusion Classification of mental disorders is based on a growing body of research in the clinical and biological sciences that makes periodic re-evaluation of diagnoses necessary. In the case of some diagnoses, such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, diagnostic changes may result in identification of youths who can be stabilized with safer more effective treatments. In other cases, such as autism spectrum disorder, the change may be more controversial because of concerns about stigma, even though the diagnostic revision may cause more individuals with Asperger's disorder to become eligible for supportive services. Regardless of the changes in DSM-5, forensic psychiatrists who treat youths and adults who have neurodevelopmental and other childhood disorders are in a position to educate legal professionals, to inform policy decisions, and to influence mental health and legal outcomes for a group of affected individuals for years to come. We welcome the challenge.
