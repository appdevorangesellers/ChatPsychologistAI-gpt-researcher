The DSM-IV criteria required developmental delay or abnormal function to begin before the person's third birthday. However, in DSM-5, the symptom presentation for autism spectrum disorder must be evident during early development “but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life” (Ref. 1, p 50). The DSM-5 criteria capture the myriad clinical presentations of individuals within the autism spectrum. This consolidation may hinder the efforts of policy makers who use specific DSM-IV diagnoses (i.e., autistic disorder versus Asperger's disorder versus pervasive developmental disorder, NOS, to determine which individuals receive public support for rehabilitation and therapeutic services, e.g., education, therapy, health care, and housing). However, elimination of the artificial distinction may reduce the pressure that was encountered occasionally by clinicians to overdiagnose autistic disorder so that affected individuals could qualify for support services. A welcome addition to the DSM-5 autism spectrum disorder classification is the requirement for mental health professionals to individualize assessments by determining how therapeutic “intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask difficulties in at least some contexts” (Ref. 1, p 53). Although the clinical presentation may change, especially after effective therapeutic interventions, a child who has autism spectrum disorder continues to have that diagnosis as an adult “even if the symptoms are no longer present” (Ref. 1, p 54). These changes may enhance the thoroughness of forensic testimony or make it more challenging, since adults do not have to meet all diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder if, in the judgment of the evaluator, the disorder is present. Forensic experts may be expected to focus on capacity and impairment, rather than on exact diagnosis. The DSM-5 has lowered the threshold for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder by emphasizing the importance of adaptive functioning and clinical assessment. The revised diagnostic criteria may place a financial burden on agencies and organizations that are charged with the duty of distributing funds equitably to qualifying individuals. Only time will tell what the long-term outcome will be, but forensic psychiatrists may be consulted to review cases on behalf of agencies and individuals regarding eligibility for services and diagnostic updates. Forensic psychiatrists are asked to provide evaluations and testimony about capacity or competence, sentence mitigation, and rehabilitation needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Expert witnesses are now in a position to reinforce the fact that there are no clear lines of diagnostic distinction between DSM-IV autistic disorder and related disorders. An evaluation of an individual with autism spectrum disorder should include a determination of whether or which support services are needed to reduce the individual's impairment by improving his adaptive functioning. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder The increasing prevalence of the diagnosis of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) has received significant media attention because of concerns about overdiagnosis and overprescribing of stimulants.8,–,13 The competitive advantage in academics and athletics that stimulant use may afford individuals who do not have AD/HD is also troubling.14,–,16 Recreational use of stimulants (Ref. 17 and APA, unpublished manuscript, 2011) may contribute to addictive disorders, life-threatening health problems, and legal problems.15,16 Despite these concerns, the changes in the DSM-5 criteria for AD/HD have lowered the threshold for making the diagnosis in individuals who are older than 17 years, in whom the prevalence is 2.5 percent (Ref. 1, p 61). For diagnosis of AD/HD in adults, DSM-5 has reduced the minimum number of inattention symptoms from six to five and the age of symptom onset from before 7 years to before 12 years. These changes were made because recollection of childhood symptoms by adults “tends to be unreliable” (Ref. 1, p 61). Examples are provided to aid with diagnosing AD/HD in older individuals. Forensic psychiatrists are likely to consult on cases involving AD/HD when individuals have been denied supportive services in primary or secondary school or reasonable accommodations in college or the workplace. Criminal court cases involving possession of stimulants, the ability of an individual with AD/HD to follow and comprehend legal proceedings without stimulant therapy (which is not generally prescribed in adult penal institutions due to, among other things, security concerns associated with narcotics), and psychosis related to stimulant use may involve psychiatric expert evaluation and testimony. Lowering the diagnostic threshold is likely to increase the number of requests for forensic psychiatric consultation in civil litigation, workplace and education accommodation reviews, and disability benefit petitions. Specific Learning Disorder Learning disorders is another area in which there are fewer diagnoses in DSM-5 than in DSM-IV. In DSM-5 several DSM-IV learning disorders have been consolidated into a single diagnosis, specific learning disorder. Specifiers will be used to identify domains of restricted educational progress. For example, the diagnosis formerly called reading disorder is now specific learning disorder with impairment in reading. Specific learning disorder, which tends to be apparent in most affected individuals during the early school years, persists even when the affected individual is able to maintain average achievement “by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support” (Ref. 1, p 69). The diagnosis also may be made when a person who is intellectually gifted demonstrates “unexpected academic underachievement” (Ref. 1, p 69) or uses “compensatory strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support” (Ref. 1, p 69) to sustain satisfactory achievement but shows impairment when barriers, such as timed examinations, impede his capacity to achieve (Ref. 1, p 69). Individuals with specific learning disorder may become involved in legal proceedings when the need for supportive services or reasonable accommodations in education, employment, or community settings\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-IV<|>EVENT<|>The DSM-IV is a previous version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that classified various mental health disorders, including autism spectrum disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>EVENT<|>The DSM-5 is the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that revised the criteria for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder and other mental health conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disorder characterized by a range of symptoms affecting social interaction, communication, and behavior, with criteria revised in DSM-5.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a mental health condition that has seen changes in diagnostic criteria in DSM-5, affecting how it is diagnosed in adults.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Specific Learning Disorder is a diagnosis in DSM-5 that consolidates several previous learning disorders into one, with specific criteria for educational progress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Forensic psychiatrists are mental health professionals who provide evaluations and testimony regarding individuals' mental health in legal contexts, including cases involving autism spectrum disorder and AD/HD.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-IV<|>DSM-5<|>The DSM-5 revised the criteria established in DSM-IV for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder and other mental health conditions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 provides the current diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, which were updated from DSM-IV<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 includes revised criteria for diagnosing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, impacting how it is assessed in adults<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DSM-5<|>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER<|>The DSM-5 consolidates previous learning disorders into the diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, changing how educational progress is assessed<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>Forensic psychiatrists may be consulted to evaluate individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder for legal cases and eligibility for services<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<|>Forensic psychiatrists may provide evaluations and testimony regarding individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in legal contexts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISORDER<|>Forensic psychiatrists may be involved in cases concerning Specific Learning Disorder, particularly regarding educational accommodations<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
