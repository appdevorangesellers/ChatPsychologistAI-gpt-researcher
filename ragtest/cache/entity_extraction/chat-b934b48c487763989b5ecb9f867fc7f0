Seligman (2002)\nsuggested that examining behavior that positively affects\nyoung adults’ well-being is necessary for developing poli-\ncies to improve the mental health of college students. The\npurpose of the current study is to examine whether debt-\nand financial-capability-related characteristics are associ-\nated with the flourishing or languishing of young adults,\nbased on Keyes’s mental health continuum, and to explore\nthe relationship between student loan and credit card debt\nand the mental health of young adults.\nReview\nI\nD\n:\nt\ni\n0\n0\n2\n0\nof Literature\nDebt Burden and Mental Health\nFinancial\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n0\n9\n5\nstrain resulting from financial problems such as\nreduced income and increased debt has been previously\nassociated with perceived psychological stress and poorer\nmental health (Kahn & Pearlin, 2006). Debt has been specif-\nically linked to subjects’ psychological functioning (Brown\net al., 2005), depressive symptoms (Hojman et al., 2016),\nand mental disorders (Jenkins et al., 2008). Credit card debt\nhas been linked to financial stress and negative health out-\ncomes (Adams & Moore, 2007; Nelson et al., 2008).\nDebt Burden and Mental Health of Young Adults. There\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n0\n0\nhas been a steady increase in the number of college stu-\ndents reporting psychological problems (Cooke et al., 2004;\nEisenberg et al., 2009; Fink, 2014; Roberts et al., 1999).\nDuring periods of economic uncertainty, the potential health\nrisks of carrying a financial burden from the cost of a col-\nlege education may be larger if there is unstable employment\nto maintain stable income than otherwise anticipated (Law,\n2014).\nDetrimental Effects of Credit Card and Financial Debt\non Mental Health. Financial\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n0\n5\ndifficulty resulting from col-\nlege students’ financial debt (Cooke et al., 2004; Richard-\nson et al., 2017) was associated with mental health problems\nof undergraduate students. Concerns related to finances\nincreased for undergraduate students as they progressed\nthrough college (Cooke et al., 2004). Furthermore, Robb\n(2017) found that financially stressed students were also\nmore likely to report lower subjective financial well-being.\nHigh levels of financial debts were associated with poor\nsocial functioning (Hoeve et al., 2014).\nDetrimental Effects of Student Loan Debt on Mental\nHealth. Very\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n1\n0\nfew studies have examined the association\nbetween subjective well-being and student loan debt of\nyoung adults (Tay et al., 2017). However, understanding\nthe relationship between student loan debt and well-being,\nincluding its impact on positive emotions, and whether stu-\ndent loan debt also affects young adults’ ability to thrive\nacross multiple domains of life can help broaden the debate\non student loan debt (Nissen et al., 2019). Tay et al. (2017)\nfound that the association between student loan debt and\nfinancial satisfaction was mediated by financial worry.\nHeckman et al. (2014) identified debt and financial insuffi-\nciency to be two significant financial stressors for college\nstudents. Other studies have found that student loan debt was\nnegatively associated with life satisfaction, psychological\nwell-being, and financial wellness of individuals (Aboagye\n& Jung, 2018; Kim & Chatterjee, 2019). Letkiewicz et al.\n(2014) found that students who had higher amounts of stu-\ndent loan debt (more than $50,000) were more likely to\ntake longer than 4 years to graduate from college. Addition-\nally, Johnson et al. (2016) found that students had very little\nknowledge regarding student loans. Lee et al. (2019) found\nthat student loan debt increased the risk of debt delinquency\namong households.\nMental Health as a Continuum\nUnlike\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n1\n5\nother areas of psychology, which study psycholog-\nical deficiencies in individuals, the field of positive psy-\nchology emphasizes factors that improve the well-being of\nindividuals. Keyes (2002) suggested a continuum of men-\ntal health, including flourishing, moderate mental health,\nand languishing. Keyes and Waterman (2003) suggested\nthat an individual’s perceived or subjective well-being is a\nself-assessment of their mental health and their psycholog-\nical and social functioning. This categorization presents a\nbroader paradigm of mental health beyond the more con-\nventionally accepted states of mental disorder or absence of\nmental disorder (Keyes, 2002, 2006).\nStudies\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n1\n2\n0\nshow that those flourishing are more adaptive\nto challenges than non-flourishers (Bergs\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
