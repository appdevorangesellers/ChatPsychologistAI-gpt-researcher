Mentalizing has been described in the literature as reflective functioning, theory of mind, metacognition, insight, and perspective-taking (151). Mentalizing deficits have been reported in several clinical populations, including individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and more recently, developmental traumas (152–155). Children and adolescents with DT demonstrate impaired mentalizing (i.e., reflecting functioning), referring to the capacity to effectively understand oneself (needs, strengths, and limitations) and others (e.g., that others may have worldviews that differ from one's own). Early interpersonal trauma and insecure attachment correlate with low reflective functioning (154, 156–158). Scholars have surmised that these children are likely dissociating (and therefore undermining their intra/interpersonal awareness), fearful and anxious, and preoccupied with maintaining compulsive and highly ritualistic behaviors (41, 159). For example, in response to sexual trauma, victims often report experiencing contamination anxiety such as body shame and disgust and overwhelming fear, that being near others will result in contact contamination (160–162). These individuals, in turn, engage in social avoidance, excessive cleansing, handwashing, and relentless reassurance-seeking to make sure they don't increase the likelihood of illness or misfortune in others.Executive functions and self-regulation capacities Executive functions refer to diverse cognitive abilities including working memory, mental flexibility, and information processing that regulate attention, mood, and behavior; enable adaptive, goal-focused actions; and are instrumental to effective coping, problem solving, and success in school, work, and relationships (163). Traumatic stress is known to cause measurable adverse effects on executive functions (121, 134, 164). For example, recent studies, including several meta-analyses, have found that trauma negatively correlates with working memory, inhibition, and mental flexibility; the adverse effects are often higher for children exposed to multiple traumas compared to those reporting isolated events (93, 165, 166). These executive functioning challenges often result in significant shifts in mood and energy that interfere with concentration, decision-making, and social-interpersonal functioning. Children and adolescents with symptoms consistent with DTD whose symptoms include reckless, disinhibited, and destructive behaviors are likely to have multiple and intersecting psychiatric disturbances, such as conduct disorder and antisocial personality traits, which are known to predict high incarceration rates and recidivism. In turn, these children may grow up feeling stigmatized, unprotected, and personally flawed, which further perpetuates their depression, anger, low self-esteem, and existential despair as well as their increased risk of learning disorders, vocational problems, and criminal records (12, 13, 167, 168).Clinical assessment Patients with DT present with signs of mood disturbances (e.g., poor frustration tolerance, emotional numbing, anger, rage), behavior disturbances (e.g., inflexible routines, self-injurious behaviors, impulsivity), and cognitive disturbances (e.g., inattention, disorganized thinking, poor problem solving), as well as sensory processing problems such as sensitivity to sound and touch as well as limited time and body awareness (169, 170). They often show signs of a heightened startle reflex, dissociation, fear, and anxiety and are often unable to be soothed by others (171–173). For example, studies of children who have experienced trauma and polyvictimization suggest that these children display greater physiological reactivity to threats such as traumatic reminders than children who have not experienced trauma (174–177). Clinical signs and symptoms of DTD Children and adolescents with DTD may react with either over-modulated or under-modulated behaviors. Over-modulated children appear hyperactive and aggressive, whereas under-modulated children appear depressed, withdrawn, and possibly dissociative. Children and adolescents with DTD may be highly reactive to their environment (e.g., hypersensitive to sounds, touch, lights) or appear to be relatively indifferent to their immediate surroundings (80, 178). They may react to perceived threats with avoidance, tantrums, or anger, especially when they feel emotionally vulnerable or disempowered. When children or adolescents with symptoms consistent with DTD appear distractible, impulsive, and/or highly aggressive, these children are likely to be classified with ADHD (hyperactive and impulsive or combined subtype), conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and/or oppositional defiant disorder (179–182). These individuals may indeed meet diagnostic criteria for several of these psychiatric disorders, however, they may be secondary to DTD, and, as such, require different clinical evaluation and treatment approaches. On the other hand, individuals with DTD who are anxious, withdrawn, dissociative, and rigid (adhering to strict behavioral routines) are more likely to be diagnosed (and sometimes misdiagnosed) with neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) because trauma symptoms such as emotional numbing, difficulty socializing with others, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, poor mentalizing (perspective taking), and poor verbal expression mirror characteristics of children with ASD (39, 41). Likewise, studies suggest that, when controlling for comorbid PTSD, individuals with DTD have higher rates of ADHD, social and separation anxiety disorders, panic disorders, severe mood and behavior disturbances, depression, and suicide (28, 183). Children and adolescents with indications of DTD, such as those with multiple ACEs (i.e., polyvictimization), are more likely to display suicidal behaviors and make suicide attempts than individuals without early interpersonal traumas (16). Likewise, these children may have higher rates of school absenteeism and learning disorders due to DTD (184, 185). Children with DTD are affected across cognitive (e.g., learning, attention, and information processing), physiological (e.g., fight-or-flight, susceptibility to infections including from common colds and flu), emotional (e.g., depression\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
