We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nPsychologist Kate Eshleman, PsyD, says that often, children can move on from traumatic events and thrive. But they may need a helping hand. “There are things parents and caregivers can do to support a child after trauma.”\nUnderstanding adverse childhood experiences\nChild health experts often talk about adverse childhood experiences (sometimes called ACEs) — traumatic events in a child’s life.\nSome ACEs are clearly terrifying — such as abuse, witnessing extreme violence or surviving a natural disaster.\nBut kids see the world differently than adults do and can experience distress from things that might not seem so scary to grown-ups, says Dr. Eshleman. Events like chronic bullying at school, the death of a family member or divorce can also traumatize a child.\n“Parents should be mindful that even though an event might not seem traumatic to them, it may have been traumatic for their child,” she says.\nLingering effects of stress: risk factors\nMany children who experience an adverse event don’t have long-lasting effects. Still, some factors increase the chance of later problems, Dr. Eshleman says:\nTrauma can leave a stamp at any age. But children who experience an adverse event before the age of 8 may be particularly vulnerable.\nLevel of trauma\nNot everyone experiences trauma the same way. Some kids can bounce back from major stressors while others are more affected by things that, on the surface, seem less severe. Overall, the more extreme the trauma, the higher the risk for lasting difficulty.\nDuration of trauma\nChronic or repeated exposure to adverse events increases the risk of lasting health problems. Children who witness repeated violence in an unsafe neighborhood, or those who are abused, are more likely to have long-term problems than a child who experiences a one-time event, such as a car crash.\nEffects of childhood trauma\nPast traumas can stay with a child — and even affect their physical health. Children who experience traumatic events have a greater chance of developing health conditions, including:\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nSubstance use disorders.\nThere are two main ways that trauma can cause those lingering effects, Dr. Eshleman explains:\n“The body responds to emotional stress in much the same way it responds to physical stress,” Dr. Eshleman says.\nElevated proteins: After physical head injuries such as concussions, levels of a protein called S100B can spike in the brain. Researchers found similarly high levels of this protein in children who had experienced emotional trauma. S100B is associated with potentially damaging inflammation in the brain.\nHigh levels of stress hormones: Stress affects the body from head to toe. When something scary happens, stress hormones set your heart racing and make you break into a cold sweat. But if those hormones stay elevated for a long time, they can cause inflammation in the body and lead to lasting health problems. “The stress response can wear on our bodies,” Dr. Eshleman says.\n“Sometimes, significant stress or trauma can lead to mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression,” says Dr. Eshleman. And people with untreated mental health problems are:\nAt increased risk for disease.\nLess likely to make healthy choices, like seeing the doctor regularly or eating well.\nMore likely to turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as drinking and smoking.\nSupport and treatment for childhood trauma\nIf you’re caring for a child who has survived trauma, you might be feeling overwhelmed by all the possible outcomes. It’s worth repeating: Those outcomes aren’t inevitable. As a caregiver, you can take steps to reduce the risks for your child:\nHear what your child is saying\n“Sometimes, adults minimize the significance of a traumatic event such as bullying,” Dr. Eshleman says. You may be trying to help your child by taking the “it’s not so bad” approach.\nBut trauma might make your child shut down — when you want them to let you in. Validate your child’s experience. Let them know that you understand how hard the experience was and that you’re there to help.\nWatch for clues\nIt’s not always easy for children to explain what they’re thinking. After a distressing event, look for changes in behavior. These can be clues that your child is having a difficult time. Some common changes to watch for include:\nEating more or less than usual.\nSleep changes, including having trouble sleeping or needing more sleep than usual.\nRegression (such as a potty-trained preschooler having accidents again, or a toddler who slept through the night now waking frequently).\nIrritability and grumpiness.\nClinginess and separation anxiety — especially in younger kids.\nTalk it out\n“Encourage opportunities for discussion and allow kids to express their thoughts and feelings,” says Dr. Eshleman.\nAsk for help\nMental health professionals can use tools such as trauma-focused treatments to help children recover from trauma. Not sure where to start? Dr. Eshleman recommends talking to your pediatrician for recommendations.\nTake care of yourself\nIf your child has been through a trauma, there’s a good chance the experience was stressful for you as well. “Make sure you’re getting the support you need and engaging in healthy behaviors. If you’re having difficulty coping, seek help for yourself, too,” says Dr. Eshleman.\nAdults: It’s not too late to deal with childhood trauma\nDoes this all sound a little too familiar? Not everyone gets the support they need in childhood. You may recognize that your own ACEs dealt you a bad hand. And you might still be dealing with the emotional and physical consequences.\nHelp is available at any age. “There are a variety of therapies that are very effective at treating anxiety, depression and PTSD,” Dr. Eshleman says. “It’s never too\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLEVELAND CLINIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cleveland Clinic is a nonprofit academic medical center that provides clinical and hospital care, and is involved in research and education.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KATE ESHLEMAN<|>PERSON<|>Kate Eshleman, PsyD, is a psychologist who provides insights on childhood trauma and its effects on children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>EVENT<|>Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) refer to traumatic events in a child's life that can have lasting effects on their health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANXIETY<|>EVENT<|>Anxiety is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPRESSION<|>EVENT<|>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest, affecting how one feels, thinks, and handles daily activities.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KATE ESHLEMAN<|>CLEVELAND CLINIC<|>Kate Eshleman is a psychologist associated with Cleveland Clinic, providing expertise on childhood trauma<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>KATE ESHLEMAN<|>Kate Eshleman discusses the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences on children's mental health<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Adverse Childhood Experiences can lead to the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANXIETY<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Experiencing Adverse Childhood Experiences can increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPRESSION<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Adverse Childhood Experiences can contribute to the onset of depression in children<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
