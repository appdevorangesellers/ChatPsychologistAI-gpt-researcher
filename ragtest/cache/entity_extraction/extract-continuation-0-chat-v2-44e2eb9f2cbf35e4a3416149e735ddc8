Increased risk of cognitive delays in the children was the most consistent finding, with some studies also reporting that children of mothers with postnatal depression had increased risk of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and increased general psychopathology (Sanger and others 2015). Accordingly, treatment of maternal mental health problems can reduce suffering in the mother while potentially preventing mental and developmental disorders in the children.Postnatal depression is the condition for which interventions are most amenable to integration into primary care and maternal and child health platforms (Rahman, Surkan, and others 2013). Such integration requires task-shifting strategies, supported by the development of training curricula and treatment packages that bundle skills that are logically grouped together for content, training, and operational use (Patel and others 2013).These interventions also require a change in the approach of mental health specialists, as well as health policy and planning specialists—a shift of focus from a model that is specialist and center based to a model that is primary care and community based. Integrated treatment programs, in which health and social care providers are supported to manage common mental health problems, offer a chance to treat the whole person. This approach is more patient centered and is often more effective than one in which mental, physical, and reproductive health problems are addressed separately without effective communication among providers (Patel and others 2013).Maternal and child health workers are well-positioned to adopt comprehensive approaches to care, which is particularly important for children because their psychosocial well-being is closely linked to the mental health of their parents and the quality of their family and school environments. Maternal and child health workers have knowledge of community resources and health, social, and education services, and they can better respond to the specific needs of local communities. In Pakistan, the Canadian “Learning through Play” program was adapted and taught through one-day workshops to women in the Lady Health Workers program, members of the local community who deliver preventive maternal and child health care. A cluster randomized trial demonstrated that an evidence-based program for maternal mental health and child development can be delivered through existing local health workers in an LMIC (Rahman, Surkan, and others 2013).In Chile, a multicomponent intervention for postnatal depression was evaluated in a randomized control trial of 230 women. The intervention consisted of group education about illness and symptoms, problem-solving strategies for mothers, and structured pharmacotherapy when required, delivered through existing local primary care clinics. Compared with those who received treatment as usual, mothers with depression had significant improvements. This study demonstrates the efficacy and feasibility of delivering care to mothers with postnatal depression in an LMIC (Rojas and others 2007).Participatory women’s groups are also a viable model of intervention for postnatal depression. Improvements in maternal and infant health were achieved in a study of 19,030 births in rural India through monthly participatory groups facilitated by peers. The study involved the identification of maternal and neonatal health problems, identification of solutions, and implementation and evaluation of strategies in partnership with local health services (Tripathy and others 2010). This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of participatory women’s groups in reducing postnatal depression in a very poorly resourced region of India.Much of the research on psychological and psychosocial interventions for maternal depression has been conducted in HICs (Sockol, Epperson, and Barber 2011). Substantial evidence indicates that such interventions are effective in reducing depressive symptoms within the first year postpartum (relative risk = 0.70, 95 percent CI: 0.60 to 0.81) (Dennis and Hodnett 2007). Over the past decade, evidence of the effectiveness of interventions led by non-mental health specialists (for example, by nurses, health visitors, or midwives) has increased (Crockett and others 2008; Lumley and others 2006; MacArthur and others 2003; Morrell and others 2009; Roman and others 2009).In LMICs, the public health importance of maternal mental health has led to increased research on interventions. A review and meta-analysis identified 13 trials that included 20,092 participants (Rahman, Fisher, and others 2013). In all these studies, the intervention was delivered by supervised, nonspecialist health and community workers; in many of the studies, the intervention was integrated into a primary care platform. Compared with routine care, the evidence suggests significant benefits for mothers and children from the interventions tested. The pooled effect size for maternal depression was 0.38 (95 percent CI: –0.56 to –0.21). Where assessed, the benefits to children included improved mother-infant interaction, better cognitive development, reduced diarrheal episodes, and increased rates of immunization.Cognitive Behavioral TherapyCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention used for the management of anxiety disorders in children. The components of CBT for children consist of cognitive interventions and behavioral strategies. The cognitive interventions teach children to recognize their anxious feelings and the somatic experiences that accompany anxiety (for example, breathlessness and palpitations), identify the anxious thoughts that are associated with the anxious feelings, develop alternative thoughts (for example, positive self-talk) and other coping strategies, and evaluate the differences in their emotions after using the coping strategies. The behavioral interventions include relaxation training, modeling behaviors, and graded exposure to anxiety-provoking stimuli.A meta-analysis of 41 studies examined the effectiveness of CBT compared with waitlist control, treatment as usual, and other interventions (James and others 2013). Compared with waitlist controls, CBT had a large effect on reducing anxiety diagnoses and symptoms, with a standarized mean difference of –0.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PAKISTAN<|>GEO<|>Pakistan is a country where the Canadian “Learning through Play” program was adapted for maternal and child health care.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILE<|>GEO<|>Chile is a country where a multicomponent intervention for postnatal depression was evaluated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where participatory women’s groups were implemented to reduce postnatal depression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADY HEALTH WORKERS PROGRAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Lady Health Workers program in Pakistan involves local women delivering preventive maternal and child health care.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY<|>EVENT<|>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a psychological intervention used for managing anxiety disorders in children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>EVENT<|>Maternal mental health refers to the mental health of mothers, particularly in relation to postnatal depression and its impact on children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANGER<|>PERSON<|>Sanger is an author of a study discussing the effects of maternal postnatal depression on children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAHMAN<|>PERSON<|>Rahman is an author involved in research on maternal mental health interventions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROJAS<|>PERSON<|>Rojas is an author of a study evaluating an intervention for postnatal depression in Chile.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIPATHY<|>PERSON<|>Tripathy is an author of a study on participatory women’s groups in India.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LADY HEALTH WORKERS PROGRAM<|>PAKISTAN<|>The Lady Health Workers program operates in Pakistan to deliver maternal and child health care<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>PAKISTAN<|>Maternal mental health interventions are integrated into primary care platforms in Pakistan<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>CHILE<|>Maternal mental health interventions were evaluated in Chile<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>INDIA<|>Maternal mental health interventions were implemented through participatory women’s groups in India<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANGER<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>Sanger's study discusses the impact of maternal postnatal depression on children<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAHMAN<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>Rahman's research focuses on interventions for maternal mental health<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROJAS<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>Rojas evaluated an intervention for maternal mental health in Chile<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIPATHY<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>Tripathy's study on participatory women’s groups addresses maternal mental health<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH<|>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a psychological intervention relevant to managing maternal mental health issues<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
