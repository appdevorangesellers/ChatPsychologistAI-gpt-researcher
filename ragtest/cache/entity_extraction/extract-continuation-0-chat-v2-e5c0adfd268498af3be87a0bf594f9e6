PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC9352895 PMID: 35935425 Abstract Children exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and pervasive interpersonal traumas may go on to develop PTSD and, in most cases, will further undergo a significant shift in their developmental trajectory. This paper examines contemporary research on Developmental Trauma (DT), which is inextricably linked to disruptions in social cognition, physiological and behavioral regulation, and parent-child attachments. Developmental trauma associated with early experiences of abuse or neglect leads to multi-faceted and longstanding consequences and underscores critical periods of development, complex stress-mediated adaptations, and multilevel, trans-theoretical influences in the diagnostic formulation and treatment of traumatized children, adolescents, and adults. Psychological and medical correlates of Developmental Trauma Disorder are considered, and directions for future research are discussed. Keywords: developmental trauma disorder, complex trauma, adverse childhood experiences, PTSD, Bronfenbrenner's There has been much interest in understanding the prevalence and impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which refer to potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood and adolescence (e.g., abuse, rejection, and abandonment by caregivers; loss of a caregiver; interpersonal violence exposure). Recent developments suggest that multiple, repeated experiences of ACEs and interpersonal traumas have broad, cumulative, and lasting effects [e.g., (1, 2)]. Children are more likely than adults to lack the cognitive and behavioral capacities to understand and respond to traumatic circumstances effectively. Children affected by interpersonal trauma often experience more global and profound changes than adults who conceivably have more developed adaptations to stress and more cognitive resources to mitigate risks and promote resiliency. The current article provides discussion of how early, repeated interpersonal traumas can interrupt the development of secure attachment and precipitate the emergence of chronic and severe traumatic adaptations, followed by an analysis of contemporary research, conceptual and diagnostic issues, and assessment and treatment. The paper concludes with a discussion about future directions for research and practice. Trauma and PTSD Children and adults who have experienced trauma and developed measurable mental health symptoms associated with the trauma may present with indications of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that warrant careful diagnostic evaluation. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder brought on by exposure to a highly stressful and potentially life-threatening event such as a natural disaster, motor vehicle accident, witnessing family or community violence, experiencing abuse and neglect, or losing a loved one. The symptoms of PTSD, as defined by the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, are characterized by persistent\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HACKENSACK MERIDIAN HEALTH MOUNTAINSIDE MEDICAL CENTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center is a healthcare facility located in Montclair, NJ, United States, involved in providing medical services and research related to trauma and mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DANIEL CRUZ<|>PERSON<|>Daniel Cruz is a medical professional affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, focusing on developmental trauma and its effects on children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATTHEW LICHTEN<|>PERSON<|>Matthew Lichten is a mental health professional in independent private practice in Clifton, NJ, United States, contributing to research on trauma and PTSD.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEVIN BERG<|>PERSON<|>Kevin Berg is a medical professional affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, involved in research on developmental trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREETHI GEORGE<|>PERSON<|>Preethi George is a medical professional affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, focusing on trauma-related research and treatment.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Developmental trauma refers to the psychological and emotional impact of adverse childhood experiences that disrupt a child's development and can lead to PTSD and other mental health issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop after exposure to traumatic events, characterized by symptoms such as flashbacks, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DANIEL CRUZ<|>HACKENSACK MERIDIAN HEALTH MOUNTAINSIDE MEDICAL CENTER<|>Daniel Cruz is affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, where he conducts research on developmental trauma.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATTHEW LICHTEN<|>INDEPENDENT PRIVATE PRACTICE<|>Matthew Lichten operates an independent private practice in Clifton, NJ, focusing on trauma and mental health issues.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEVIN BERG<|>HACKENSACK MERIDIAN HEALTH MOUNTAINSIDE MEDICAL CENTER<|>Kevin Berg is affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, contributing to research on developmental trauma.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PREETHI GEORGE<|>HACKENSACK MERIDIAN HEALTH MOUNTAINSIDE MEDICAL CENTER<|>Preethi George is affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Mountainside Medical Center, focusing on trauma-related research and treatment.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Developmental trauma can lead to the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in affected individuals.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
