Traits such as high sensitivity to stress or a tendency toward negative thinking can also make emotional regulation more challenging. 5 disorders related to emotional dysregulation1. Borderline personality disorder (BPD): BPD is characterized by intense emotions, unstable relationships, and impulsive behaviors. Emotional dysregulation is a core symptom of this disorder, making it difficult to maintain emotional stability.2. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Emotional dysregulation is common in people with ADHD. You might experience rapid mood swings and intense emotions, which can affect your ability to focus and maintain relationships.3. Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder involves significant mood swings between mania and depression. These mood shifts can make it hard to regulate emotions and maintain a stable mood.4. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Those of us with PTSD often struggle with emotional dysregulation as a result of trauma. You may experience intense emotional reactions, flashbacks, and difficulty calming down.5. Depression and anxiety disorders: Chronic depression and anxiety can lead to persistent feelings of irritability, sadness, and unease. These conditions can exacerbate emotional dysregulation, making it harder to manage emotions effectively.\nWhat causes emotional dysregulation?Emotional dysregulation can come from various causes, which often interact in complex ways. Understanding the potential origins of emotional dysregulation can help you find effective treatments and strategies for managing it. Genetic factorsSome people may have a genetic predisposition to emotional dysregulation. This means that if emotional dysregulation or related mental health issues run in your biological family, you might be more likely to experience similar challenges. Inherited traits can influence how the brain processes emotions, making it harder for some of us to regulate our feelings effectively.Environmental influencesThe environment in which you grow up can play a significant role in emotional regulation. Early childhood experiences, such as neglect, abuse, or inconsistent caregiving, can disrupt the development of healthy emotional regulation skills. Chronic stress from family conflicts, financial instability, or exposure to violence may also contribute to difficulties in managing emotions.Biological factorsEmotional dysregulation may also be linked to biological factors, including neurochemical imbalances and brain function abnormalities. Neurotransmitters, which are chemicals in the brain that help transmit signals, can affect mood and emotions. If these chemicals are imbalanced, it may lead to problems with emotional regulation. Certain brain areas responsible for regulating emotions may also function differently in people with emotional dysregulation.Psychological factorsCo-occurring mental health conditions and certain personality traits can contribute to emotional dysregulation. For example, those of us with anxiety, depression, or borderline personality disorder (BPD) often struggle with regulating our emotions. Traits such as high sensitivity to stress or a tendency toward negative thinking can also make emotional regulation more challenging. 5 disorders related to emotional dysregulation1.
