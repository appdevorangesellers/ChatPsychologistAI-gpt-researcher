Many youths encounter challenges and setbacks as they navigate the social and educational systems on their way to independence. This can be a normal part of the developmental process and may be conducive to the refinement of coping skills, as well as the development of empathy and resilience. However, a setback may also be the manifestation of a mental disorder, when a change in biological, psychological, or developmental functioning results in a youth's enduring behavioral, cognitive, or emotional impairment (Ref. 1, p 20).Many of the disorders in DSM-5 that have their onset during childhood and adolescence, such as autism spectrum disorder, can be found in a chapter titled “Neurodevelopmental Disorders.” Others, including conduct disorder and reactive attachment disorder, are located elsewhere in The Manual. Neurocognitive disorders, which are acquired disorders that may affect children and adolescents but primarily are diagnosed in adults, will not be addressed in this article. Autism Spectrum Disorder The level of impairment experienced by individuals with pervasive developmental disorders, which are characterized by deficits in social interaction, varies from mild to severe. In DSM-IV, individuals with Asperger's disorder and those with autistic disorder show deficits in social interaction and restricted, repetitive behavior. Individuals with autistic disorder also have early signs of cognitive developmental delay and language deficits. The DSM-5 Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group determined that autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified, were not being applied consistently and correctly by clinicians. This inconsistency was obfuscating efforts to understand these disorders and to identify effective treatment interventions. The Work Group addressed this concern by using a dimensional approach to reclassifying these five maladies as a single diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder. A table provided in DSM-5 in the neurodevelopmental disorders chapter (Ref. 1, pp 34–6) provides examples of the different levels of severity. Specifiers for autism spectrum disorder include whether there is accompanying intellectual or language impairment or an association with a medical or genetic condition or environmental factor; with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder; or with catatonia. Thus, for example, in the absence of intellectual impairment, the DSM-5 diagnosis for a person with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Asperger's disorder is autism spectrum disorder without intellectual impairment and without structural language impairment. The decision to subsume Asperger's disorder as part of autism spectrum disorder has been controversial. Many clinicians, teachers, parents, and advocates fear that the change will stigmatize individuals with Asperger's disorder because autism historically has been thought of as a more severe disease.3,–,5 This concern has been particularly troubling in regard to high-functioning individuals with Asperger's disorder who have learned to adapt in the classroom, workplace, and elsewhere; some affected individuals have even managed to function without accommodations and without disclosing the diagnosis. Although Asperger's disorder is no longer a separate diagnosis, individuals and clinicians may continue to use the term in the interest of reducing the stigma and preserving the therapeutic alliance. Also, some have voiced concerns that removing the Asperger's disorder diagnosis from DSM-5 will cause affected individuals to lose eligibility for educational and other supportive services.6,7 However, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder are broader than the DSM-IV classifications for both autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder. The DSM-IV criteria required developmental delay or abnormal function to begin before the person's third birthday. However, in DSM-5, the symptom presentation for autism spectrum disorder must be evident during early development “but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life” (Ref. 1, p 50). The DSM-5 criteria capture the myriad clinical presentations of individuals within the autism spectrum. This consolidation may hinder the efforts of policy makers who use specific DSM-IV diagnoses (i.e., autistic disorder versus Asperger's disorder versus pervasive developmental disorder, NOS, to determine which individuals receive public support for rehabilitation and therapeutic services, e.g., education, therapy, health care, and housing). However, elimination of the artificial distinction may reduce the pressure that was encountered occasionally by clinicians to overdiagnose autistic disorder so that affected individuals could qualify for support services. A welcome addition to the DSM-5 autism spectrum disorder classification is the requirement for mental health professionals to individualize assessments by determining how therapeutic “intervention, compensation, and current supports may mask difficulties in at least some contexts” (Ref. 1, p 53). Although the clinical presentation may change, especially after effective therapeutic interventions, a child who has autism spectrum disorder continues to have that diagnosis as an adult “even if the symptoms are no longer present” (Ref. 1, p 54). These changes may enhance the thoroughness of forensic testimony or make it more challenging, since adults do not have to meet all diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder if, in the judgment of the evaluator, the disorder is present. Forensic experts may be expected to focus on capacity and impairment, rather than on exact diagnosis. The DSM-5 has lowered the threshold for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder by emphasizing the importance of adaptive functioning and clinical assessment. The revised diagnostic criteria may place a financial burden on agencies and organizations that are charged with the duty of distributing funds equitably to qualifying individuals. Only time will tell what the long-term outcome will be, but forensic psychiatrists may be consulted to review cases on behalf of agencies and individuals regarding eligibility for services and diagnostic updates. Forensic psychiatrists are asked to provide evaluations and testimony about capacity or competence, sentence mitigation, and rehabilitation needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Expert witnesses are now in a position to reinforce the fact that there are no clear lines of diagnostic distinction between DSM\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DSM-5 is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which provides standardized criteria for the classification of mental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, and it encompasses various conditions previously classified separately, such as Asperger's disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPBERGER'S DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Asperger's Disorder was previously classified as a separate diagnosis but is now included under Autism Spectrum Disorder in DSM-5, characterized by social interaction deficits without significant cognitive delays.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS<|>PERSON<|>Children and adolescents are individuals in the developmental stages of life who may experience various psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTAL DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Mental disorders are conditions that affect mood, thinking, and behavior, which can manifest in children and adolescents as they navigate social and educational systems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Forensic psychiatrists are mental health professionals who evaluate individuals for legal purposes, including those with autism spectrum disorder, to assess capacity and impairment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>DSM-5<|>Autism Spectrum Disorder is classified and defined within the DSM-5, which provides the diagnostic criteria for the disorder<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASPBERGER'S DISORDER<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>Asperger's Disorder has been subsumed under Autism Spectrum Disorder in DSM-5, indicating a change in classification<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS<|>MENTAL DISORDER<|>Children and adolescents may experience mental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, as part of their developmental challenges<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORENSIC PSYCHIATRISTS<|>AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER<|>Forensic psychiatrists evaluate individuals with autism spectrum disorder for legal cases, focusing on their capacity and impairment<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
