Financial stress is not only overwhelming, but it also affects our mental and emotional well-being beyond our bank accounts. Whether you’re dealing with mounting debt, a job loss, or uncertainty about the future, financial worries can lead to anxiety, depression, and physical health issues. However, there are strategies and techniques that can help you better manage financial difficulty to regain a sense of control over your life and mental well-being. Here at Plus by APN, we like to take a holistic approach to mental health. That’s why we focus on more than just your diagnosis and traditional treatment plans. To help facilitate a healthy mental ecosystem, let’s explore 20 effective ways to cope with financial stress. Additionally, we’ll discuss how therapists can provide support in navigating financial challenges by helping to problem-solve and holding you accountable. Understanding Financial Stress Before we delve into financial stress coping strategies, it’s essential to understand the nature of financial strain. Financial challenges may arise for a variety of reasons, including: Debt Mounting credit card debt, student loans, or mortgage payments can create significant financial strain and make the essentials of everyday life difficult to afford. It is estimated that the average American is about $104,215 in debt across mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and credit cards. Job Loss or Insecurity Losing a job or facing the threat of unemployment can lead to immense stress and anxiety about meeting financial obligations. It is estimated that around 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and nearly half of Americans have less than $500 in savings to cover them through an emergency. Without financial protection, job loss can mean not being able to afford rent or pay for groceries. Income Instability Irregular income or fluctuations in earnings can make it challenging to budget and plan for the future. According to Forbes, one third of Americans have irregular income streams. Unexpected Expenses Sometimes, life happens. Medical emergencies, car repairs, or home maintenance issues can quickly deplete savings and increase financial strain. Retirement Planning Concerns about retirement savings, investments, and financial security in later years can contribute to long-term stress. It is estimated that roughly half of Americans are not adequately prepared to pay for basic expenses throughout retirement. 20 Strategies for Managing Financial Stress Given these facts and figures, it’s easy to see why someone might be experiencing financial difficulty. In the face of such overwhelming stress, it’s easy to want to push it away and keep getting by the best we can. However, the only way to get out of a problem and improve our mental health is to face the issue head-on. Below is a list of 20 strategies that can help you do that. 1. Create a Budget The first thing you’ll want to do is create a budget. This involves tracking all your income and essential expenses while making sure your accounts are balanced. If there is money left over, that can be allocated to other things like savings, debt payoff, and personal spending. If your essential expenses are greater than your income, you’ll want to look into other solutions such as financial assistance programs. Establish a realistic budget to gain control of your resources. 2. Set Financial Goals Define short-term and long-term financial goals to provide direction and motivation for your financial decisions. No goal is too big or too small. However, it’s important to start with small, obtainable goals and work your way up from there. 3. Build an Emergency Fund Emergencies happen. That’s why it’s important to save a portion of your income on a regular basis to create a financial safety net for unexpected expenses or loss of income. A good rule of thumb is to aim for 6 months of essential expenses in savings, which is about $36,000 for the average American. 4. Communicate Openly Discuss financial concerns with your partner or family members to develop a shared understanding and collaborative approach to managing finances. Keeping things quiet tends to further exacerbate financial problems and can even cause strain in relationships where your finances are dependent on one another. 5. Seek Financial Education Educate yourself about personal finance topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, and debt management to make informed financial decisions\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLUS BY APN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plus by APN is a mental health organization that offers interventional psychiatry, therapy, and neurotech to support individuals in managing their mental health.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMANTHA CARTER<|>PERSON<|>Samantha Carter is the author of the article discussing strategies for managing financial stress.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CNBC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CNBC is a news organization that provides financial news and information, including articles on savings and financial management.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NerdWallet<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NerdWallet is a personal finance company that offers advice and tools for managing finances, including retirement savings.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORBES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Forbes is a media company that publishes articles on business, finance, and investing, including statistics on income instability.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINANCIAL STRESS<|>EVENT<|>Financial stress refers to the anxiety and worry caused by financial difficulties, impacting mental and emotional well-being.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMANTHA CARTER<|>PLUS BY APN<|>Samantha Carter is associated with Plus by APN as the author of the article on financial stress management<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CNBC<|>NerdWallet<|>Both CNBC and NerdWallet provide information and resources related to personal finance and savings<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORBES<|>NerdWallet<|>Forbes and NerdWallet both discuss personal finance topics, including income instability and retirement planning<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINANCIAL STRESS<|>PLUS BY APN<|>Plus by APN addresses financial stress through mental health support and coping strategies<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
