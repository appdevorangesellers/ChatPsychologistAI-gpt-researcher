The behavioral description of conduct disorder overlaps considerably with the behavior exhibited by individuals with psychosis, mood disorders, and PTSD. Also, many youths with conduct disorder become involved in the juvenile justice system, where the prevalence of mental disorders is higher than in the general population, even when conduct disorder is excluded.26 Perception of the limited prosocial emotions specifier has not been studied in juvenile court judges. However, when conduct disorder with callous and unemotional features was studied in mental health professionals who evaluate justice-involved youths, the response was both negative and punitive. This outcome has led to concerns about the influence of this specifier on mental health professionals and on the jurists and attorneys to whom they provide expert consultation.27 The facility with which the conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions diagnosis can be made increases the likelihood that other treatable diagnoses may be overlooked, as often happens when mental health services in juvenile corrections facilities are reviewed.28,29 The concern extends to youths charged with more serious offenses, whose cases are bound over or waived from juvenile to criminal court. These individuals tend to have more serious mental disorders than youths whose cases remain in the juvenile court system.30 Although defense attorneys have concerns about the adjudicative competence of youths who seem to lack the maturity to understand the legal process and to assist in their defense,31 immaturity is not considered a mental disease or defect for purposes of adjudicative incompetence.32 Juveniles also are more likely than adults to make false confessions.33 Consequently, in the United States, a youth with conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions may be adjudicated delinquent or bound over, even if he does not understand the legal process and has treatable mental disorders that have been overlooked. Although youths should not be absolved of responsibility for their actions, those with treatable mental disorders should not be overlooked, but rather should be placed in juvenile and other settings that foster mental health rehabilitation. For example, DSM-5 indicates that “individuals with conduct disorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders and substance-related disorders as adults” (Ref. 1, p 473). Nevertheless, in the discussion accompanying the diagnosis, the prevalence of these evolving mental disorders in children and adolescents is not discussed, and an opportunity to alert diagnosticians to the need for early identification of and interventions for affected individuals is missed. Conduct disorder with limited prosocial emotions represents a defined condition that may alter the trajectory of the lives of youths who have undiagnosed but more treatable comorbid disorders. The absence of exclusionary criteria illuminates the dangers associated with using DSM-5 inappropriately in forensic settings. It also suggests that, in rare cases, it may unintentionally contribute to adverse outcomes, even when it is used for its intended purpose. DSM-5 and Legal Practice Although there are many changes in DSM-5 that may enhance how mental disorders are classified and studied, one thing has not changed: the danger of legal professionals, policy makers, and others using The Manual to advance legal, political, and nonmedical agendas. It is important, therefore, for child forensic psychiatrists to be familiar with the “Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” (Ref. 1, p 25). DSM-5 is not intended for legal use. Legal professionals who use the text to address matters pertaining to children and adolescents risk misinterpreting or misusing the information. The child and adolescent forensic mental health professional who is cognizant of the “imperfect fit between legal questions to be addressed and questions of ultimate concern to the law” (Ref. 1, p 25) is in an excellent position to remind legal professionals of the drawbacks associated with using the DSM-5 in resolving legal questions. Conclusion Classification of mental disorders is based on a growing body of research in the clinical and biological sciences that makes periodic re-evaluation of diagnoses necessary. In the case of some diagnoses, such as disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, diagnostic changes may result in identification of youths who can be stabilized with safer more effective treatments. In other cases, such as autism spectrum disorder, the change may be more controversial because of concerns about stigma, even though the diagnostic revision may cause more individuals with Asperger's disorder to become eligible for supportive services. Regardless of the changes in DSM-5, forensic psychiatrists who treat youths and adults who have neurodevelopmental and other childhood disorders are in a position to educate legal professionals, to inform policy decisions, and to influence mental health and legal outcomes for a group of affected individuals for years to come.
