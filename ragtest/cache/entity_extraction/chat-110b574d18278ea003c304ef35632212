This learning begins in early childhood. After relying completely on caregivers in infancy, during early childhood children begin to develop the ability to regulate their own emotions and cope with stress. Focusing on those early years, this chapter reviews what we know about the development of emotion regulation and coping. We also note gaps in our knowledge that must be addressed for a full accounting of the development of such important aspects of children’s functioning. We highlight the need to understand relations among early stress reactivity and emotional development, and the intersecting trajectories of emotion regulation and coping development. Because most early childhood research focuses on individual differences, we underscore the importance of also studying regulation and coping as within-person processes.
