Subsequent work by medical anthropologist Allan Young further demonstrated how psychological trauma relies on two levels of narrative: 1) an internal logic describing a cause-effect relationship between a past event and present symptoms, and 2) memory as a constructed representation of a traumatic event (Young, 1997, 2004). Young (1997) also showed that trauma varied so dramatically across historical periods and cultures that we cannot assume that past generations represented their traumatic experiences in the same way we would today. Further, because trauma is a representation as opposed to an event, and because we cannot directly know the minds and lives of the past, we cannot assume that our way of responding to negative events is valid for prior generations. Viewing trauma as narrative—representations that contain both personal and public components—directs our focus to the development and impact of present-day representations and their connection to the historic past. To the extent that historical trauma is a narrative representation, it connects histories of group-experienced traumatic events to present day experiences and contexts, including the contemporary health of a group or community. Thus, historical trauma operates through a layering of narrative turns, including trauma as a concept represented in stories, history as socially endorsed memory, and an internal logic linking history to present suffering or resilience (Crawford, 2013). A narrative framework for historical trauma offers improved conceptual clarity and opportunity for scientific investigation into the relationship between trauma and present-day health by considering the ways in which historical traumas are represented in contemporary individual and community stories. Further, conceptualizing historical trauma as a public narrative avoids problems with projecting contemporary theory back in time, while calling on scholars to engage the full, culture-laden complexity of public narratives in scientific inquiry. In subsequent sections, we review the existing research on historical trauma across cultures, elaborate on historical trauma as public narrative, and describe the links between psychological health and personal and public narratives. Finally, we present a simplified theoretical model that specifies how historical trauma as a public narrative influences individual and community health.Existing Research and Theory on Historical Trauma A number of empirical studies have shown that groups who have histories of trauma are more vulnerable to diminished psychological health in later generations. Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews show that children of Holocaust survivors from Israel to Canada are more vulnerable to PTSD, and Barel, Van IJzendoorn, Sagi-Schwartz, and Bakermans-Kranenburg’s (2010) meta-analysis shows that second and third generation offspring of Holocaust survivors display both remarkable resilience and heightened post-traumatic stress symptoms. Daoud, Shankardass, O’Campo, Anderson, and Agbaria (2012) documented lower self-rated health, poorer socio-economic status, and higher stress among Palestinians displaced during the Nakba of 1948 and their descendants in comparison to families who were not displaced. Karenian et al. (2011) found elevated post-traumatic stress symptoms among descendants of the Armenian genocide that, while persistent, seem to be fading with every subsequent generation. Several studies of Canadian First Nations indigenous peoples have found that a family history of forced boarding school attendance and removal from one’s family and community is associated with a number of subsequent behavioral health challenges in later generations, including: increased exposure to sexual violence and involvement in child welfare systems (Pearce et al., 2008), injection drug use (Lemstra, Rogers, Thompson, Moraros, & Buckingham, 2012), current depressive symptoms and increased exposure to trauma (Bombay, Matheson, & Anisman, 2011), and a history of abuse associated with suicidal thoughts and attempts (Elias et al., 2012). Among a sample of North American Plains Indians, Whitbeck, Adams, et al. (2004) have shown that historical trauma affects psychological health through the experience of loss. Their research has demonstrated that, among Native Americans, the frequency of thinking about losses associated with historical traumas: is associated with distressed feelings (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004); mediates the effect of perceived discrimination on alcohol abuse (Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, & Adams, 2004); is distinct from depression (Whitbeck, Walls, Johnson, Morrisseau, & McDougall, 2009); and is a significant source of distress over and above other proximate stressors, such as childhood adversity and negative life events (Walls & Whitbeck, 2011). The empirical research on historical trauma has followed the growth of theory that links historical trauma to individual and community health. Bar-on et al. (1998) apply attachment theory to explain the preponderance of insecure-ambivalent attachment observed among children of Holocaust survivors, an observation supported in Kellermann’s (2001a, 2001b) reviews of research with this population that showed a predisposition to anxiety-related disorders in later generations. Brave Heart and DeBruyn (1998) point out that government policies toward the Lakota people disrupted culture-based grieving processes, thus resulting in mass unresolved grief. A number of scholars further argue that the violent colonization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas disrupted culture-based protective factors, community systems, and parenting knowledge, thus leading to increased psychosocial risk, inadequate parenting, and health disparities in this population (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011; Crawford, 2013; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Kirmayer, Brass, & Tait, 2000).
