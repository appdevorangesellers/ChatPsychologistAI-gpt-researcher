Our narrative model of historical trauma is heuristic in that it emphasizes the possible recursive influences between historical trauma narratives, contemporary reminders of that trauma, narrative salience of the trauma within personal and public contexts, and health impacts. We provide a brief description of each component of the model below. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Narrative Model of How Historical Trauma Impacts Health: Public narratives connect historical traumas to health impacts through public and personal contemporary reminders and the degree of narrative salience. Each stage of the narrative model is recursively influential of the connecting stages.Historical Trauma Narratives The left side of Figure 1 depicts historical trauma narratives, that is, public narratives that are present-day, culturally-constructed accounts for a particular group. These narratives link the historical past through meaning-making to contemporary circumstances (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013) as depicted in subsequent stages in the model. Following from Wertsch (2008), these stories shape the collective memories of group traumas in the sense that they are stories collectively told, received, interpreted, and re-told—historical trauma narratives are the mechanisms by which memories of historical traumas are shaped and conveyed.Contemporary Reminders of Historical Trauma A strict definition of narrative requires a narrator telling the story; however, narratives as such are not the only mechanism by which information on historical traumas are communicated. For example, photography provides powerful visual representations that can serve as reminders of past atrocities (Sontag, 2003). Such contemporary reminders contextualize one’s lived-experience and interpretation of historical traumas. Research with children in Russia showed that situational reminders of trauma, such as walking past shelled buildings or encountering memorials at school, were found to be the greatest source of distress for the children (Scrimin et al., 2011). Similarly, Layne et al. (2010) identified general trauma reminders, such as the news, as the strongest mediator between war trauma exposure and PTSD and functional impairment among Bosnian children. Whitbeck, Adams et al.’s (2004) measure of historical loss exemplifies this process within the context of historical trauma, whereby contemporary contexts and experiences provide reminders of the historical losses. Conversely, reburial ceremonies serve as public symbols that not only highlight the past trauma, but may also promote healing and resilience (Eppel, 2002; Honwana, 1997; Pollack, 2003). Similar to Scrimin et al.’s (2011) distinction between external (e.g., situational and media) and internal (e.g., bodily sensations and affective states) reminders, we divide historical trauma reminders into public and personal reminders. Public reminders are publically available or experienced events, symbols, contexts, systems, and structures that serve to remind people of historical trauma narratives, such as a new event similar to the past traumatic events, media-portrayed stereotypes, lack of resources, contaminated living environments, and pervasive poverty. Aboriginal reservations and decaying urban environments are examples of structural and physical contexts that can provide daily reminders of historic processes of loss, marginalization, discrimination, and trauma: “An empty city lot is not just the rubble of a razed building, but for the people who have seen it decay it is haunted by memories of the past” (Simms, 2008, p. 88). Also, dominant cultures often perpetuate oppressive public narratives about marginalized groups through media and other public communications, acts, and symbols (Rappaport, 2000), such as Native American sports mascots (Fryberg, Markus, Oyserman, & Stone, 2008). Personal reminders are individually experienced and relate to historical trauma through an individual’s personal narratives. Examples of personal reminders are perceived discrimination, personal life difficulties, personal trauma experiences, and microaggressions (Sue et al., 2007). As Sue et al. (2007) have noted: “…microagressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults” (p. 273). The extensive research on microaggressions provides powerful examples of how daily indignities are often embedded in narratives of historical oppression and trauma so as to serve as reminders and continuations of past oppression and trauma (Michaels, 2010).Narrative Salience Figure 1 also depicts how historical trauma narratives may be more or less salient to an individual or community. Should a person not experience nor perceive any present impact of historical trauma, a narrative of trauma will not have as much meaning to them, even if they are aware of that history. Present conditions and experiences are what make historical trauma narratives relevant to the present and future. Conversely, if a historical trauma narrative is highly salient and accessible to an individual, present conditions and daily indignities also become more readily apparent as part of the historical trauma narrative. Just as dominant cultural narratives serve as reminders of historical traumas, family and community narratives of resilience, action, and aspiration can provide a counter-weight to oppressive dominant cultural narratives (Rappaport & Simkins, 1991). Symbols of marginalization bring to life the traumas in historical trauma narratives (Evans-Campbell, 2008; Simms, 2008), whereas symbols of resistance and persistence bring to life messages of resilience and well-being (Denham, 2008; Fullilove, 1996).Health Impacts Finally, the figure also shows how narrative salience influences health impacts. Although Brave Heart (2003) emphasizes psychological distress as a common historical trauma response, as noted previously, other scholars have identified a range of negative health outcomes in response to historical trauma\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological harm experienced by a group due to historical events, which can influence health and well-being across generations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The narrative model of historical trauma emphasizes the recursive influences between historical trauma narratives and contemporary reminders, linking past traumas to present health impacts.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCRIMIN ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who studied the impact of situational reminders of trauma on children in Russia.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAYNE ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who identified trauma reminders as mediators between war trauma exposure and PTSD among Bosnian children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITBECK, ADAMS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who developed a measure of historical loss in the context of historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPPPEL<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who discussed reburial ceremonies as symbols that highlight past trauma and promote healing.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONWANA<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who contributed to the understanding of historical trauma and resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLLACK<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who explored the connections between historical trauma and healing processes.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMMS<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who discussed the impact of physical environments as reminders of historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAPPAPORT<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who examined how dominant cultures perpetuate oppressive narratives about marginalized groups.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUE ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who studied microaggressions and their relation to historical trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICHAELS<|>PERSON<|>Researcher who provided examples of how daily indignities are embedded in narratives of historical oppression.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The narrative model connects historical trauma narratives to health impacts through contemporary reminders and narrative salience<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCRIMIN ET AL.<|>LAYNE ET AL.<|>Both sets of researchers studied the effects of trauma reminders on children, linking their findings to historical trauma<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITBECK, ADAMS ET AL.<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>The measure of historical loss developed by these researchers is part of the narrative model's framework<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPPPEL<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>Epppel's work on reburial ceremonies contributes to the understanding of how public symbols can promote healing in the context of historical trauma<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HONWANA<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>Honwana's research on resilience complements the narrative model by providing insights into counter-narratives against trauma<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMMS<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>Simms' discussion of physical environments as reminders of trauma aligns with the narrative model's emphasis on contemporary reminders<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAPPAPORT<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>Rappaport's examination of dominant cultural narratives relates to the narrative model's focus on public narratives of trauma<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUE ET AL.<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>The research on microaggressions by Sue et al. connects to the personal reminders aspect of the narrative model<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICHAELS<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>Michaels' examples of daily indignities relate to the personal narratives within the narrative model<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
