Two of the screening tools identified as useful were the Ten Questions (TQ) screen (Belmont 1986; Zaman and others 1990) and the ACCESS portfolio (Wirz and others 2005).The TQ screen (box 8.2) is a brief questionnaire administered to parents of children ages two to nine years. Five questions assess cognitive ability; two questions assess movement ability; one question addresses any history of seizures; one assesses vision; and one assesses hearing. The items require a dichotomous response of yes-no and ask about the skills that children will acquire in any culture. They ask parents to compare their children to other children in their community (Belmont 1986; Zaman and others 1990). The TQ was included as a disability module in the third round of the United Nations Children’s Fund Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and administered to almost 200,000 children across 18 countries (Gottlieb and others 2009). The TQ is a sensitive tool that identifies 80–100 percent of children with developmental disorders; however, it has a low specificity, necessitating a second stage to examine those children who screen positive (Durkin and others 1994).Box 8.2Ten Questions Screen. Compared with other children, did the child have any serious delay in sitting, standing, or walking? Compared with other children, does the child have difficulty seeing, either in the daytime or night?Administration of the ACCESS portfolio provides screening of children with developmental disorders, as well as simple advice to parents. Community health workers (CHWs) in Sri Lanka and Uganda used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children younger than age three years whose mothers had expressed concerns. The CHWs’ assessments of delay had an 82 percent accuracy in children older than age two years, compared with those identified by medical or allied health staff, although the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument were not measured. The ACCESS portfolio raised awareness of developmental disorders in communities, and CHWs and parents reported it to be helpful (Wirz and others 2005).Two significant issues arise following the identification of children with developmental disorders. The first involves the stigma associated with these diagnoses in some countries and cultures. The second is the limited evidence for the effectiveness of community-based rehabilitation for children with intellectual disabilities and autism in LMICs. These issues do not necessarily indicate that interventions are ineffective, but rather that further evaluation is required (Hastings, Robertson, and Yasamy 2012; Robertson and others 2012).Parenting Skills TrainingParenting skills training aims to enhance or support the parental role through education and training, thereby improving emotional and behavioral outcomes for children. A meta-analysis identified four components of parenting skills training that were particularly effective. Increasing positive parent-child interactions, teaching parents how to communicate emotionally with their children, teaching parents the use of time out as a means of discipline, and supporting parents to consistently respond to their children’s behaviors had the largest effects on reducing externalizing behaviors in children (Kaminski and others 2008).Several systematic reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of parenting skills training in reducing internalizing and externalizing problems in children (Furlong and others 2013; Kaminski and others 2008), as well as in reducing the risk of unintentional childhood injuries (Kendrick and others 2007) and improving the mental health of parents (Barlow and others 2014). Childhood disruptive and externalizing behaviors may persist into adolescence, affecting peers, schools, and communities (Fergusson, Horwood, and Lynskey 1994). Furthermore, although many externalizing behaviors diminish as individuals mature through adolescence, life course persistence of antisocial behaviors is more likely in those with childhood-onset conduct problems (Moffitt and others 2002). A meta-analysis of group-based parenting skills training for parents of children with conduct problems showed moderate effect sizes with a standardized mean difference in conduct problems of –0.53 (95 percent confidence interval [CI]: –0.72 to –0.34) as assessed by parents (Furlong and others 2013). Therefore, parenting skills interventions can reduce or prevent the onset of childhood mental disorders and subsequent adverse health and social outcomes.The evidence for the effectiveness of parenting skills training comes from studies conducted in HICs (Furlong and others 2013). A systematic review of parenting interventions in LMICs reported that most studies examined educational or physical outcomes (Mejia, Calam, and Sanders 2012). However, eight studies examined interventions to prevent or reduce emotional and behavioral problems in children. The following outcomes were assessed:Infant attachment (Cooper and others 2009)Maternal understanding and attitude about child development (Jin and others 2007; Klein and Rye 2004; Rahman and others 2009)Mother-child interaction (Klein and Rye 2004; Wendland-Carro, Piccinini, and Millar 1999)Child abuse (Aracena and others 2009; Oveisi and others 2010)Reductions in child behavioral problems (Fayyad and others 2010).The mean effect size of the parenting skills training across the eight studies was large (Cohen’s d = 0.81) (Mejia, Calam, and Sanders 2012); benefits persisted in the follow-up studies, which were as long as 18 months in a study in South Africa (Cooper and others 2009) and six years in a study in Ethiopia (Klein and Rye 2004). Thus, emerging evidence from available research suggests parenting skills training is a feasible and effective intervention in LMICs. The extensive research base available from HICs requires integration with knowledge acquired from studies conducted in LMICs for the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN’S FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is an organization that conducts surveys and assessments related to children's health and development across various countries.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SRI LANKA<|>GEO<|>Sri Lanka is a country where community health workers used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children with developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UGANDA<|>GEO<|>Uganda is a country where community health workers used the ACCESS portfolio to assess children with developmental disorders.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The ACCESS portfolio is a screening tool used by community health workers to assess children for developmental disorders and provide advice to parents.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEN QUESTIONS SCREEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Ten Questions (TQ) screen is a brief questionnaire used to assess cognitive and developmental abilities in children aged two to nine years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>Developmental disorders refer to a range of conditions that affect a child's development, including cognitive, movement, and social skills.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING<|>EVENT<|>Parenting skills training is an intervention aimed at enhancing parental roles through education and training to improve outcomes for children.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDHOOD MENTAL DISORDERS<|>EVENT<|>Childhood mental disorders are psychological conditions that can affect children, often persisting into adolescence and adulthood.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>SRI LANKA<|>The ACCESS portfolio was utilized by community health workers in Sri Lanka to assess children for developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACCESS PORTFOLIO<|>UGANDA<|>The ACCESS portfolio was utilized by community health workers in Uganda to assess children for developmental disorders<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEN QUESTIONS SCREEN<|>UNITED NATIONS CHILDREN’S FUND<|>The Ten Questions screen was included as a disability module in UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARENTING SKILLS TRAINING<|>CHILDHOOD MENTAL DISORDERS<|>Parenting skills training aims to reduce or prevent the onset of childhood mental disorders<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS<|>TEN QUESTIONS SCREEN<|>The Ten Questions screen is designed to identify children with developmental disorders<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
