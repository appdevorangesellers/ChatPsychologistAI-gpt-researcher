Wills Dr. Wills is Director of Child and Adolescent Forensic Psychiatric Services and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.MDFind this author on Google ScholarFind this author on PubMedSearch for this author on this site ArticleInfo & Metrics PDF AbstractIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the classification of mental disorders for children and adolescents has been revised. Although some changes are welcome and needed, others have been controversial. In this article, I examine the diagnostic changes along with some of the associated controversies and resolutions. The implications for the practice of child forensic psychiatry, including problems that may be encountered by forensic psychiatrists who evaluate adults with childhood-onset mental disorders, are examined. The pitfalls associated with improper use of The Manual by legal professionals are also reviewed.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 represents the culmination of a multinational interdisciplinary effort to incorporate a body of empirical studies into a resource for classifying mental illness (Ref. 1, p.7). The DSM-5 Child and Adolescent Disorders Work Group was cognizant of the controversy surrounding their recommendation to reclassify several DSM-IV2 disorders, including some that affect children and adolescents. The contents of DSM-5, at times, reflect their responsiveness to those concerns.3In this article, I examine changes in DSM-5 regarding disorders that have their onset primarily in childhood and adolescence and I focus on disorders that are more likely to be encountered by child forensic psychiatrists in the course of practice. The discussion may also be of interest to forensic mental health professionals who work with adults who have childhood-onset mental disorders.The implications of a mental disorder in a child or adolescent are substantial. The disorder may interfere with normal development and the youth's efforts to relate to family and peers and to reach normal developmental milestones, such as becoming independent, caring for himself, interacting with peers, and obtaining an education. Therefore, identifying and addressing psychiatric disorders in children is imperative.Although the end of childhood has been legislatively defined for educational, legal, and other purposes, there is no evidence-based endpoint for the neurodevelopmental period. For this reason, DSM-5 contains no references to the age at which the neurodevelopmental period ends and adulthood begins. Yet, the point at which individuals are reasonably expected to transition from childhood to adulthood is the crux of many of the controversies involving psychiatric disorders, including those affecting children and adolescents. Many youths encounter challenges and setbacks as they navigate the social and educational systems on their way to independence. This can be a normal part of the developmental process and may be conducive to the refinement of coping skills, as well as the development of empathy and resilience. However, a setback may also be the manifestation of a mental disorder, when a change in biological, psychological, or developmental functioning results in a youth's enduring behavioral, cognitive, or emotional impairment (Ref. 1, p 20).Many of the disorders in DSM-5 that have their onset during childhood and adolescence, such as autism spectrum disorder, can be found in a chapter titled “Neurodevelopmental Disorders.” Others, including conduct disorder and reactive attachment disorder, are located elsewhere in The Manual. Neurocognitive disorders, which are acquired disorders that may affect children and adolescents but primarily are diagnosed in adults, will not be addressed in this article. Autism Spectrum Disorder The level of impairment experienced by individuals with pervasive developmental disorders, which are characterized by deficits in social interaction, varies from mild to severe. In DSM-IV, individuals with Asperger's disorder and those with autistic disorder show deficits in social interaction and restricted, repetitive behavior. Individuals with autistic disorder also have early signs of cognitive developmental delay and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMY EDITORIAL BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Academy Editorial Board is responsible for overseeing the publication and content of the journal, ensuring quality and relevance in academic contributions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHERYL D.
