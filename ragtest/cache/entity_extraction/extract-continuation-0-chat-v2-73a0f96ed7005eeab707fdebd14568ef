It can affect attention, concentration and higher cognitive functions, such as working memory [1], as well as the levels of stress, anxiety and depression [2]. The prevalence of sleep problems has increased exponentially since the COVID-19 outbreak [3,4,5], underlining the urgency to prevent and treat sleep problems, in order to preserve long-term physical and mental health [6].In this special issue, we address the important topic of sleep-related daytime functioning with publications on a variety of sleep disorders, their pathophysiological mechanisms, comorbid conditions and daytime consequences. First, the paper by Reddy and Van der Werf sheds light on the important function of sleep, during which replenishing and cleansing of the brain occurs by enhancing glymphatic clearance. Toxic effects on brain functioning that occur in the context of, for example, Alzheimer’s disease, can be limited by this clearance. The paper summarizes how lifestyle choices during the day and night, such as stress reduction and Omega-3 consumption, can further enhance this gly\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELLEMARIJE ALTENA<|>PERSON<|>Ellemarije Altena is a researcher affiliated with the Institut de Neurosciences Cognitives et Intégratives d’Aquitaine, focusing on sleep and its effects on daytime functioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JASON G.
