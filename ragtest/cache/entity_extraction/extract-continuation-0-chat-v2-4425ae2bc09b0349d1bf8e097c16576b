For example, for indigenous youth and sexual minority youth, group affiliation can encourage a sense of participation in a political struggle evidencing collective strength (Wexler et al., 2009). Resilience in response to adversity and trauma is, in this way, a process in negotiation with influential public narratives such as those conveying group histories of trauma and survival. Just as individuals express resilience through narratives of transformation following traumatic events (McAdams et al., 2001; Tebes et al., 2004), so too do groups and communities represent group resilience in narratives of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Denham, 2008; Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) illustrates this effectively by tracing how narrative frames family identity and resilience strategies through four generations of an American Indian family. Family and public narratives, hence, influence the formation of personal narratives, the interpretation of one’s contexts, and the response to personal and collective traumas. Psychological well-being is related to one’s ability to process narratives and form coherent life stories and interpretations (Pals, 2006; Ville & Khlat, 2006). For example, the ability to develop autobiographical coherence linking one’s sense of self to the past and future, referred to as self-continuity, is predictive of suicide risk (Chandler, 1994). Like self-continuity, Chandler and Lalonde (2009) have shown how cultural-continuity—the degree to which a community engages in actions symbolic of their sense of community as a cultural group—functions as a protective factor and moderator of behavioral health problems among some indigenous Canadian communities. Historical trauma that results from colonization may lead to diminished cultural continuity, which may lead to limited collective action to preserve and advance a cultural legacy (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009). Conversely, narratives of continuity and cultural revitalization promote resiliency (Kirmayer, Dandeneau, Marshall, Phillips, & Williamson, 2011). Strong cultural identity may be emblematic of public resilience in the face of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013). For example, Taylor and Usborne (2010) argue that reconstruction of a strong cultural identity following collective trauma, such as war or disaster, is critical in subsequent individual and community well-being. Their research has shown that clarity in one’s cultural identity predicts personal well-being and that clarity in one’s self-concept mediates this relationship across diverse cultures (Usborne & Taylor, 2010). Furthermore, cultural identity represents the interaction between public norms and self-concept readily expressed in narratives (Gone, Miller, & Rappaport, 1999). International research demonstrates that, across many cultures, family and community narratives contextualize an intergenerational self-concept that serves an important protective role, such as for adolescents (Fivush, Habermas, Waters, & Zaman, 2011) or among marginalized groups who may face daily discrimination (Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) and Crawford (2013) both emphasize how for indigenous people in North America family narratives of historical trauma play a central role in how children situate themselves with respect to adversity and resilience.A Narrative Model for Understanding the Impact of Historical Trauma on Health Figure 1 presents a narrative model that specifies how public narratives of historical trauma impact health. As shown, the model specifies successive recursive stages beginning with public narratives of historical trauma that frame contemporary reminders of past collective trauma for a particular group or community. These contemporary reminders influence how salient the narrative is to a person or group; conversely, the salience of the narrative to the individual is critical in determining whether an experience will be interpreted as a reminder of historical trauma(s) or not. Narrative salience also influences whether the narrative will have health implications. Similarly, health status influences the salience of historical trauma narratives; for example, if a person struggles with health outcomes that are attributed to a public narrative of historical trauma, then that narrative is more likely to be seen as relevant to one’s life. Our narrative model of historical trauma is heuristic in that it emphasizes the possible recursive influences between historical trauma narratives, contemporary reminders of that trauma, narrative salience of the trauma within personal and public contexts, and health impacts. We provide a brief description of each component of the model below. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Narrative Model of How Historical Trauma Impacts Health: Public narratives connect historical traumas to health impacts through public and personal contemporary reminders and the degree of narrative salience. Each stage of the narrative model is recursively influential of the connecting stages.Historical Trauma Narratives The left side of Figure 1 depicts historical trauma narratives, that is, public narratives that are present-day, culturally-constructed accounts for a particular group. These narratives link the historical past through meaning-making to contemporary circumstances (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013) as depicted in subsequent stages in the model. Following from Wertsch (2008), these stories shape the collective memories of group traumas in the sense that they are stories collectively told, received, interpreted, and re-told—historical trauma narratives are the mechanisms by which memories of historical traumas are shaped and conveyed.Contemporary Reminders of Historical Trauma A strict definition of narrative requires a narrator telling the story; however, narratives as such are not the only mechanism by which information on historical traumas are communicated. For example, photography provides powerful visual representations that can serve as reminders of past atrocities (Sontag, 2003). Such contemporary reminders contextualize one’s lived-experience and interpretation of historical traumas. Research with children in Russia showed that situational reminders of trauma, such as\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INDIGENOUS YOUTH<|>PERSON<|>Indigenous youth are young individuals belonging to indigenous communities, often facing unique challenges and resilience in political struggles related to their cultural identity and history.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH<|>PERSON<|>Sexual minority youth are young individuals who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community, often navigating their identities in the context of societal challenges and resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY<|>PERSON<|>An American Indian family that has been studied to illustrate the impact of narratives on family identity and resilience strategies across generations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>EVENT<|>Cultural continuity refers to the ongoing engagement of a community in actions that symbolize their cultural identity, which can serve as a protective factor against behavioral health problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma is the cumulative emotional and psychological harm experienced by a group over generations, often resulting from colonization and systemic oppression.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>EVENT<|>A narrative model that explains how public narratives of historical trauma impact health and well-being through various stages of influence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>EVENT<|>Cultural identity is the sense of belonging to a particular cultural group, which can influence individual and community resilience in the face of trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC NARRATIVES<|>EVENT<|>Public narratives are culturally constructed accounts that shape collective memories and interpretations of historical traumas for specific groups.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIGENOUS YOUTH<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>Indigenous youth often engage in cultural continuity practices that help them navigate their identities and resilience in the face of historical trauma.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEXUAL MINORITY YOUTH<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>Sexual minority youth may also participate in cultural continuity efforts that affirm their identities and foster resilience against societal challenges.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The American Indian family exemplifies how narratives of historical trauma influence their identity and resilience strategies across generations.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL CONTINUITY<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>Cultural continuity serves as a protective factor against the negative impacts of historical trauma on communities.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The narrative model illustrates how public narratives of historical trauma can influence health outcomes for affected communities.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>PUBLIC NARRATIVES<|>Cultural identity is shaped by public narratives, which influence how individuals and communities perceive their histories and resilience.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
