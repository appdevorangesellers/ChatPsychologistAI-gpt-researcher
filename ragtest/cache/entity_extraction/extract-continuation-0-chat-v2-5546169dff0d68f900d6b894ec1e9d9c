It has been suggested that DTD is set apart from PTSD in that the former is precipitated by toxic stress, referring to prolonged activation of the stress response system, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, in the absence of treatments and supportive peers and adults (78, 79). In addition, attachment disturbances associated with DTD originate at the beginning of an individual's lifespan development (e.g., parental neglect and abandonment, parents addicted to alcohol and drugs, separation from caregivers. By comparison, the causal events that lead to PTSD can occur at any point (or points) in one's life cycle. Investigations of individuals with DTD suggest that developmental trauma is often characterized by (1) poor self-identity development, (2) interpersonal sensitivity and consistent problems in relationships, including with peers, adults, and primary caregivers, (3) high rates of exposure to family and community violence, (4) high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, and (5) chronic and debilitating medical/neurological illnesses (24, 28, 34, 36, 80–82). Indeed, several studies have confirmed high comorbidities between PTSD and other disorders including depression, anxiety and panic/agoraphobia, psychotic disorders, and functional medical syndromes that might warrant differentiated assessment procedures and treatments (83–85). Studies of children living in pervasively abusive and neglectful circumstances indicate that children with characteristics of DTD commonly (often exclusively) rely on behavioral inhibition and cognitive dissociation; these responses are mediated by conditioned fear and physiological hypoarousal [i.e., the freezing adaptation of the stress response system; (86)]. Numerous studies suggest that individuals with complex traumas and DTD tend to cope with their traumas by deliberately evading reminders of the original trauma and by denying that such events occurred, including on self-report trauma symptom measures (87, 88), thereby conferring additive risks (i.e., dissociation and traumatic amnesia, undermining mental health needs). These traumatic stress adaptations, in turn, can contribute to experiences of emotional numbing and low frustration tolerance and precipitate behavioral outbursts that result in refractory (treatment-resistant) mood disturbances, long-term psychiatric hospitalizations (and re-hospitalizations), removal from school, and placement in foster care and juvenile justice treatment centers (89–93). The DSM-5 indicates that the sequelae of “prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., child abuse)” include symptoms that are consistent with DTD: “difficulties in regulating emotions or maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms” (p. 276). However, there is vigorous debate regarding the viability of this alternative designation, given that the criteria for other specified trauma and stress-related disorders are broad, lack specificity, include interpersonal and non-interpersonal antecedents, and require that providers first consider alternative-mainstream taxonomies. For example, DTD must be differentiated from PTSD, reactive and disinhibited attachment disturbances, and borderline personality disorder, the latter of which is marked by pervasive mood instability, impaired self-identity, dissociation, and provocative and confrontational interpersonal behaviors [often at extremes of the idealization and devaluation continuum; (60, 66, 68, 94)]. As such, several different approaches are used to diagnose persons who have experienced early, recurring stressors and are displaying indications of developmental trauma disorder.Developmental trauma: Diagnostic issues Researchers have developed objective procedures to diagnose children with indications of DTD (e.g., standardized interviews and psychometric instruments specifically designed to assess for trauma-mediated interpersonal and attachment disturbances). The Developmental Trauma Disorder - Semi-structured Interview (DTD-SI) is one such tool. DTD expert consensus guidelines and psychometric studies on the validity and reliability of the DTD criteria and the DTD-SI suggest that three factors differentiate DTD from other psychiatric disorders, including PTSD (24, 28, 34, 95, 96). These factors include emotion and physiological dysregulation (e.g., alexithymia, sensitivity to touch, functional neurological disorders), cognitive processing and behavioral problems (e.g., traumatic re-enactments, self-mutilation, dissociation, impaired attention, learning, memory), and poor self-other awareness (characterized by low self-esteem and self-hatred, insecure attachment, experiences of interpersonal betrayal and persistent states of anger, resentment, and revenge). PTSD preschool adaptation Another approach to diagnosing children with trauma, especially for those who fail to meet the criteria for PTSD, is to revise the requirements of the DSM so that it is more developmentally sensitive to children. The American Psychiatric Association conferred a preschool subtype PTSD diagnosis for children between the ages of 0–6, as an alternative to the standard PTSD classification that originated from work with adults (3). The alternative set of criteria used for the preschool subtype PTSD includes several changes to the standard DSM PTSD criteria, ranging from adjustments to clinical thresholds (e.g., lowered from three to one avoidance symptom) to the removal of items deemed inappropriate for children (e.g., expression of immediate distress following the trauma; nightmares that necessarily include traumatic content; a sense of a foreshortened future, which requires complex cognitive skills). DSM-5 criteria for the preschool PTSD subtype require that the “duration of the disturbance [referring to trauma symptoms] is more than 1 month” (3, p. 273). The DSM preschool subtype is also more developmentally sensitive to children in that it emphasizes symptoms of trauma that are unique to younger individuals (e.g., traumatic reenactments in interactions with peers during playtime) and focuses more on trauma that is particularly relevant for children, such\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD) is a proposed diagnosis for individuals who have experienced prolonged and severe traumatic events, particularly in childhood, leading to various psychological and emotional disturbances.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>EVENT<|>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, characterized by symptoms such as flashbacks, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The American Psychiatric Association is a professional organization of psychiatrists in the United States that publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which includes criteria for diagnosing mental health conditions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSM-5<|>EVENT<|>The DSM-5 is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which provides standardized criteria for the classification of mental disorders, including PTSD and developmental trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Children are individuals in the developmental stage of life, typically defined as being between the ages of 0-18, who may experience unique psychological effects from trauma.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Trauma refers to the emotional and psychological response to distressing events, which can lead to long-term mental health issues such as DTD and PTSD.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA DISORDER<|>POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Developmental Trauma Disorder is suggested to be distinct from PTSD, with different causes and symptoms related to prolonged stress in childhood<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION<|>DSM-5<|>The American Psychiatric Association publishes the DSM-5, which includes diagnostic criteria for various mental health disorders, including DTD and PTSD<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA DISORDER<|>Children are often the subjects of studies related to Developmental Trauma Disorder, as they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of trauma<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Children can also be diagnosed with PTSD, especially when they experience traumatic events<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA DISORDER<|>Trauma is a key factor in the development of Developmental Trauma Disorder, particularly when it occurs in childhood<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA<|>POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER<|>Trauma is the primary cause of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, leading to various psychological symptoms<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
