The physiological, attachment, and meta-cognitive disturbances seen in traumatized children intersect at multiple levels of Bronfenbrenner's model. More specifically, children and adolescents who have experienced severe trauma and ACEs experience high rates of poverty, legal problems, and violence exposure (89, 104–106). Abusive parents often have experienced their own traumas and attachment disturbances (107–109), which are often compounded by high rates of substance abuse, depression, financial stress, and unemployment (12, 110–113). Racial, ethnic, sexual, and neurodiverse minorities are affected by developmental trauma at very high rates (114, 115), suggesting that systemic factors such as state and national policies, allocation of resources for prevention and intervention, discrimination, and stigma exert influence over, and significantly impact responses to, trauma and recovery. Children with trauma live in persistent states of fear and terror, and recurring traumas become transformative developmental experiences that alter their global appraisals and future responses to stress (14, 49, 61, 116). This heightened fear propensity disrupts self-awareness, information processing, interpersonal communication, and mastery of age-appropriate developmental competencies [e.g., establishing healthy relationship parameters, identifying and expressing feelings appropriately, and tolerating ambiguity; (43, 90)] and causes individuals to have problems learning, making friends at school, and appreciating their strengths and unique abilities, which are often overshadowed by their social and behavioral difficulties. Researchers have described several adverse physiological alterations underlying cognitive disturbances in children who have experienced early traumas (13, 117–124). These include, for example, stress-mediated changes to the organization and functioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, which exert influence over fear processing, including automatic (impulsive) behavioral responses to perceived threats (125–130), learning and memory [fear memories override attention, concentration, and, in turn, inhibit learning of new information; (72, 131, 132)], and higher-order (complex) cognitive operations [e.g., problem-solving and learning from experience, stress appraisal and reappraisal, perceived controllability; (133–135)]. As an illustration of this, reinforcement and contingency learning studies indicate that children who had experienced severe adversity or developmental trauma are not able to adjust their behavior effectively to shifting environments or demands, regardless of threatening and non-threatening circumstances (136, 137). These findings suggest that individuals who have endured significant stress in their lives, especially during early childhood or adolescence, are at increased risk of experiencing avoidance, anger, frustration, and anxiety as primary ways of being in the world, regardless of their circumstances (138–140). These types of responses can be damaging to an individual's development and ability to function, particularly if their safety needs are undermined. Repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents become habituated to evaluating their surroundings for indications of threat that might render them vulnerable to additional traumas, given that they had limited opportunities to recover from the early and repeated abuse and neglect. Researchers speculate that the mechanisms involved in the development of traumatic stress adaptations correlate with diverse, interrelated psychiatric symptoms and comorbidities often reported in studies of individuals who have experienced repeated abuse and neglect. This notion is consistent with a socio-ecological framework, the developmental trauma diagnosis, and trans-theoretical models that focus on far-reaching (cross-diagnostic) effects from critical and sensitive periods, attachment and social cognition (e.g., mentalizing and perspective taking), sleep, physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and mood and personality (141–143). The role of attachment Prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers. According to attachment theorists, securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregivers to minimize anxiety and to form goal-directed partnerships, and/or interactional synchrony, where they mirror each other's communication patterns and learn to anticipate, express, and meet each other's needs. Through these interactions, children develop internal working models, which encompass individuals' core beliefs about their self-worth and lovability as well as their general expectations of others in relationships (144). Insecure attachment styles (e.g., anxious, avoidant, and disorganized) are frequently associated with interpersonal trauma (145–147). Studies have consistently linked attachment disturbances to the emergence (and maintenance) of developmental trauma symptoms, which may remain latent until interpersonal interactions later in life (e.g., peer conflicts, inadequate institutional responses to trauma, workplace challenges) give rise to memories of early trauma (148). The combination of repeated childhood trauma and the absence of parental nurturing, support, and protection (e.g., parents who are addicted to alcohol and/or drugs, are homeless, or are living in severe poverty; family violence; parental incarceration) can be particularly devastating and can potentiate DT (34, 145, 149, 150).Social cognition Cognitive science researchers have expanded upon attachment concepts to include the construct of mentalizing, which is defined as the capacity to consider the mental states of others (e.g., inferring their needs, goals, interests, and intersubjective experiences) as distinct from one's own. Mentalizing has been described in the literature as reflective functioning, theory of mind, metacognition, insight, and perspective-taking (151). Mentalizing deficits have been reported in several clinical populations, including individuals diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and more recently, developmental traumas (152–155). Children and adolescents with DT demonstrate impaired mentalizing (i.e., reflecting functioning), referring to the capacity to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRONFENBRENNER'S MODEL<|>EVENT<|>Bronfenbrenner's model is a socio-ecological framework that describes multiple levels of influence on individual development, particularly in the context of trauma and adverse childhood experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Developmental trauma refers to the psychological and emotional effects resulting from repeated exposure to traumatic experiences during childhood, impacting an individual's development and functioning.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>EVENT<|>Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events occurring in childhood that can have lasting negative effects on health and well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Trauma is a psychological response to an event that is deeply distressing or disturbing, often leading to long-term emotional and psychological challenges.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURE ATTACHMENT<|>EVENT<|>Secure attachment is a healthy emotional bond formed between a child and caregiver, characterized by trust and a sense of safety.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>EVENT<|>Insecure attachment refers to a lack of trust and safety in the relationship between a child and caregiver, often leading to emotional and behavioral issues.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENTALIZING<|>EVENT<|>Mentalizing is the ability to understand and interpret the mental states of oneself and others, crucial for healthy interpersonal relationships.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILDREN<|>PERSON<|>Children are individuals in the early stages of development, often vulnerable to the effects of trauma and adverse experiences.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADOLESCENTS<|>PERSON<|>Adolescents are young individuals transitioning from childhood to adulthood, often facing unique challenges related to trauma and development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARENTS<|>PERSON<|>Parents are caregivers who play a critical role in the emotional and psychological development of children, particularly in the context of attachment.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRONFENBRENNER'S MODEL<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Bronfenbrenner's model provides a framework for understanding the influences of developmental trauma across multiple levels of society and individual experience<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Developmental trauma is often a result of adverse childhood experiences, which can lead to significant emotional and psychological challenges<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRAUMA<|>ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES<|>Trauma is a direct consequence of adverse childhood experiences, impacting individuals' mental health and development<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURE ATTACHMENT<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>The presence of secure attachment in childhood can prevent the development of insecure attachment styles, which are often linked to trauma<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENTALIZING<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>Insecure attachment can lead to deficits in mentalizing, affecting interpersonal relationships and emotional regulation<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILDREN<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Children are particularly vulnerable to developmental trauma, which can significantly affect their emotional and psychological growth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADOLESCENTS<|>DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA<|>Adolescents who experience developmental trauma may face unique challenges in their emotional and social development<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARENTS<|>SECURE ATTACHMENT<|>Parents play a crucial role in fostering secure attachment in their children, which can mitigate the effects of trauma<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARENTS<|>INSECURE ATTACHMENT<|>Parents with their own trauma may struggle to provide secure attachment, leading to insecure attachment in their children<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
