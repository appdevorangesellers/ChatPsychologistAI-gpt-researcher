These studies have shown the therapy to be largely efficacious and incrementally supportive of the therapeutic effects of parent training (Handwerk and others 2012). PSST has also been found to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for conduct disorder. The evidence suggests that PSST can complement parenting interventions and increase the effectiveness of parenting interventions incrementally (Handwerk and others 2012). The evidence for adapting PSST to various cultures is limited, and further research is required before this intervention can be recommended in LMICs.Multisystem therapy. Multisystem therapy is a comprehensive intervention targeting adolescents with disruptive behaviors. It is a highly intensive therapy based on the use of different types of therapies deemed appropriate by individual therapists. The existing evaluations of this therapy, including meta-analyses, have demonstrated its efficacy, particularly in adolescents with more serious delinquency tendencies (Curtis, Ronan, and Borduin 2004). However, the therapy’s highly intensive nature may render it unsuitable as an intervention in LMICs.Handwerk and others (2012) provide an excellent summary of the literature on interventions targeting conduct disorders. The overall recommendations include parent training, particularly for parents of younger children, with the choice of intervention format largely a matter of personal and health system preference. The evidence base for CBI is not as extensive as that for parenting interventions; the effect sizes appear to be small to modest. Notably, the augmentation of parenting interventions with CBI appears to be particularly promising. Furthermore, CBI interventions seem to have more efficacy in adolescents.Cost-Effectiveness AnalysesThe evidence base for the cost-effectiveness of interventions targeting children and adolescents is considerably more modest than that for adults. In a systematic review of the literature that included studies published up to 2009, Kilian and others (2010) found 19 studies of the cost-effectiveness of psychiatric interventions targeting children and adolescents. Few studies use a cost-utility analysis framework, whereby outcomes are expressed as generic indices combining mortality and morbidity; a common example of such an outcome is quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The advantage of cost-utility analysis is that value-for-money judgments can be made, since thresholds of good value can be specified for QALYs in different health care settings (Drummond and others 2005). Moreover, interventions can be compared within and across different disorder categories.Studies of pharmacological interventions for ADHD have largely found such interventions to be cost-effective (King and others 2006), with existing studies finding that such interventions fall below commonly accepted thresholds of value for money in HICs (such as £30,000/QALY1). Studies that have evaluated uncertainty around the point estimates have found such conclusions to be robust (Donnelly and others 2004). Evaluations of behavioral interventions find such interventions to be cost-effective; for example, Dretzke and others (2005) find that parenting interventions for conduct disorder are cost-effective. However, sensitivity testing around this estimate shows that the results could change dramatically depending on model assumptions. Mihalopoulos and others (2007) find that modest improvements in the symptoms of conduct disorder can be associated with considerable cost-savings that outweigh the cost of implementing the parenting intervention in an Australian setting. No identified studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of interventions in LMICs.In conclusion, the evidence base of the cost-effectiveness of interventions targeting children and adolescents with mental disorders is still in its infancy. The reasons for this include the limitations of the use of generic outcome indexes, such as QALYs, in children with mental disorders, as well as the difficulties in assessing costs. Future research to fill this evidence gap is urgently needed.ConclusionsChildhood mental and developmental disorders globally account for a significant health and societal burden. The evidence base for interventions to prevent and treat mental and developmental disorders in LMICs is limited. Future implementation of programs to address childhood mental and developmental disorders in LMICs should be evaluated. Other evidence-based key recommendations for interventions are summarized in table 8.3.Table 8.3Summary of Recommendations for Interventions for Childhood Mental and Developmental Disorders. As the evidence presented in this chapter indicates, key interventions that have the potential to reduce mental and developmental disorders in childhood are parenting skills training that includes psychosocial stimulation, teacher training with “The Incredible Years” program, and maternal mental health interventions. The evidence suggests that these can be feasibly delivered in LMICs, and that they have a strong efficacy in HICs. CBT for anxiety disorders has a strong evidence base in HICs, but much more work is needed to demonstrate the feasible delivery of this intervention in LMICs. Pharmacotherapy requires specialist care and assessment that limits use in LMICs.The screening of children for developmental disorders is possible in LMICs; however, the evidence for intervening once autism or intellectual disability has been identified is limited. Similarly, child protection and reduction of bullying in schools are important preventive strategies for childhood mental disorders. The systems required for child protection are complex and require collaboration across sectors and significant government investment. Further research on interventions to protect children is urgently required in LMICs. Reducing bullying in schools may prevent mental disorders in childhood and later in life; however, there are no data to show effective programs in LMICs.The widespread implementation and evaluation of parenting skills training, including psychosocial stimulation and maternal mental health interventions, is recommended in all countries to achieve a meaningful reduction in the global prevalence and burden of childhood mental and developmental disorders.ReferencesAPA (American Psychiatric Association). 2013.
