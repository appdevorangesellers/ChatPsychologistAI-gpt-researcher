The DSM-5 has lowered the threshold for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder by emphasizing the importance of adaptive functioning and clinical assessment. The revised diagnostic criteria may place a financial burden on agencies and organizations that are charged with the duty of distributing funds equitably to qualifying individuals. Only time will tell what the long-term outcome will be, but forensic psychiatrists may be consulted to review cases on behalf of agencies and individuals regarding eligibility for services and diagnostic updates. Forensic psychiatrists are asked to provide evaluations and testimony about capacity or competence, sentence mitigation, and rehabilitation needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Expert witnesses are now in a position to reinforce the fact that there are no clear lines of diagnostic distinction between DSM-IV autistic disorder and related disorders. An evaluation of an individual with autism spectrum disorder should include a determination of whether or which support services are needed to reduce the individual's impairment by improving his adaptive functioning. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder The increasing prevalence of the diagnosis of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) has received significant media attention because of concerns about overdiagnosis and overprescribing of stimulants.8,–,13 The competitive advantage in academics and athletics that stimulant use may afford individuals who do not have AD/HD is also troubling.14,–,16 Recreational use of stimulants (Ref. 17 and APA, unpublished manuscript, 2011) may contribute to addictive disorders, life-threatening health problems, and legal problems.15,16 Despite these concerns, the changes in the DSM-5 criteria for AD/HD have lowered the threshold for making the diagnosis in individuals who are older than 17 years, in whom the prevalence is 2.5 percent (Ref. 1, p 61). For diagnosis of AD/HD in adults, DSM-5 has reduced the minimum number of inattention symptoms from six to five and the age of symptom onset from before 7 years to before 12 years. These changes were made because recollection of childhood symptoms by adults “tends to be unreliable” (Ref. 1, p 61). Examples are provided to aid with diagnosing AD/HD in older individuals. Forensic psychiatrists are likely to consult on cases involving AD/HD when individuals have been denied supportive services in primary or secondary school or reasonable accommodations in college or the workplace. Criminal court cases involving possession of stimulants, the ability of an individual with AD/HD to follow and comprehend legal proceedings without stimulant therapy (which is not generally prescribed in adult penal institutions due to, among other things, security concerns associated with narcotics), and psychosis related to stimulant use may involve psychiatric expert evaluation and testimony. Lowering the diagnostic threshold is likely to increase the number of requests for forensic psychiatric consultation in civil litigation, workplace and education accommodation reviews, and disability benefit petitions. Specific Learning Disorder Learning disorders is another area in which there are fewer diagnoses in DSM-5 than in DSM-IV. In DSM-5 several DSM-IV learning disorders have been consolidated into a single diagnosis, specific learning disorder. Specifiers will be used to identify domains of restricted educational progress. For example, the diagnosis formerly called reading disorder is now specific learning disorder with impairment in reading. Specific learning disorder, which tends to be apparent in most affected individuals during the early school years, persists even when the affected individual is able to maintain average achievement “by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support” (Ref. 1, p 69). The diagnosis also may be made when a person who is intellectually gifted demonstrates “unexpected academic underachievement” (Ref. 1, p 69) or uses “compensatory strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support” (Ref. 1, p 69) to sustain satisfactory achievement but shows impairment when barriers, such as timed examinations, impede his capacity to achieve (Ref. 1, p 69). Individuals with specific learning disorder may become involved in legal proceedings when the need for supportive services or reasonable accommodations in education, employment, or community settings is disputed. Litigation involving the validity of contracts, crisis management, harassment, discrimination, and adjudicative competence may also illuminate how specific learning disorder impedes an affected individual's ability to function in society. The prevalence of comorbidity in individuals with specific learning disorder may also result in forensic psychiatrists' assessing affected individuals and testifying during adjudicative capacity and criminal responsibility hearings. The diagnostic changes in DSM-5 will present new challenges for forensic psychiatrists in courtrooms and elsewhere, since a subgroup of evaluees who are from different cultures and who may have experienced social or educational deprivation will no longer be eligible for educational and workplace supportive services based on DSM-5 criteria for specific learning disorder. Forensic psychiatrists also will be put in the position of explaining to judges, employers, and education administrators why gifted individuals who meet DSM-5 criteria for specific learning disorder may now be eligible for those same interventions. The changes are likely to result in lively debate for forensic mental health professionals in court testimony and policy debates. Intellectual Disability and Mental Retardation Although DSM-5 avoids using terminology that blurs the lines between clinical practice and the law, there are exceptions to this principle. In 2010, Rosa's Law18 replaced the term mental retardation with intellectual disability as a matter of U.S. federal law. In keeping with this change, DSM-5 has also replaced the diagnosis mental retardation with intellectual disability, and the nomenclature in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10)19 is intellectual developmental disorder. In the text, the latter diagnosis is placed in parentheses and listed after the DSM-5 diagnosis, to facilitate the transition from DSM coding to the ICD-10 coding structure (Ref. 1, p 12).
