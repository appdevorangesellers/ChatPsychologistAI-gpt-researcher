Historical trauma, also called intergenerational trauma, refers to the cumulative emotional and psychological wounding over an individual’s lifespan and across generations, emanating from massive group trauma experiences.\nExamples include the following but can consist of any groups who have faced systemic oppression and violence.\nNative Americans from colonial destruction, land displacement, and cultural genocide\nJewish Holocaust survivors and descendants\nEnslaved Africans and inherited trauma in African American\nSome individuals may not be affected by the historical trauma, yet others might suffer from diminished physical and mental well-being. People who suffer from historical trauma can experience issues like:\nA significant inclination towards violence or aggression\nProblems with substance abuse and dependency\nElevated instances of suicide\nCardiovascular health concerns\nThe Science Behind Historical Trauma\nResearch suggests that traumatic experiences can alter an individual’s DNA — a phenomenon known as epigenetic inheritance. It means that the descendants of those who have faced significant trauma may be born with a predisposition to stress or anxiety, even if they haven’t experienced the trauma firsthand.\nAddressing the Impact of Historical Trauma\nUnderstanding and addressing historical trauma is crucial for healing and mental well-being. Here are some strategies that can help:\nCultural revitalization: Reconnecting with cultural traditions and practices can foster a sense of identity and resilience.\nTrauma-informed care: Mental health services that acknowledge and address the specific needs of those affected by historical trauma can facilitate more effective healing.\nCommunity support: Building strong, supportive communities can provide a buffer against the impacts of historical trauma.\nEducation and awareness: Raising awareness about the effects of historical trauma can encourage empathy and understanding, promoting societal change.\nCount on RADIAS Health\nRADIAS Health provides person-centered integrated healthcare services to people experiencing mental illness, substance use, or co-occurring disorders.
