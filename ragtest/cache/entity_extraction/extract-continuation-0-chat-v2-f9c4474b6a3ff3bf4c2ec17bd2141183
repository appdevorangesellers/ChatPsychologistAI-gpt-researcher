A number of scholars further argue that the violent colonization of the indigenous peoples of the Americas disrupted culture-based protective factors, community systems, and parenting knowledge, thus leading to increased psychosocial risk, inadequate parenting, and health disparities in this population (Campbell & Evans-Campbell, 2011; Crawford, 2013; Gone & Trimble, 2012; Kirmayer, Brass, & Tait, 2000). Walters et al. (2011) also contend that historically experienced traumas may be reflected in heritable biological and epigenetic mechanisms of health risk and illness. And finally, Sotero (2006) argues that, in order for theories of historical trauma to explain the link between present-day health outcomes and past trauma experienced by a particular group, they must be consistent with three overarching theoretical perspectives: 1) psychosocial theory, and specifically, the link between stress and illness; 2) political/economic theory, so as to account for structural determinants of health and illness (e.g., power inequities); and 3) social/ecological systems theory, thus accounting for multi-level influences on health and illness. These extant theories of historical trauma do not explicitly incorporate narrative as a central theoretical framework, but nor are they incompatible with such a framework. A narrative framework for historical trauma asks us to consider more carefully the nature of history. History is, in part, collective memory, and like memory, is a highly malleable, reconstructive process (see Antze & Lambek, 1996; Young, 2004; Zembylas & Bekerman, 2008). Memories of past traumatic events are constructed within social and cultural contexts, which often determine what is remembered and how it is interpreted. As Foucault (2003) points out, dominant cultures often silence or diminish the value of other cultural groups’ narratives, that is, they disqualify other people’s knowledge and limit what may be discussed publicly. Such struggles for narrative recognition may be an important element of a group’s historical trauma narrative, such as with the struggle of Armenians to have the massacres of their people by Turks during the Ottoman Empire recognized as genocide. Trauma narratives represent an interplay between personal stories and culture and, therefore, are cultural constructions of trauma (Kienzler, 2008). Cultural narratives of trauma may be especially relevant to health, perhaps more so than the actual occurrence of an event, because they frame the psychosocial, political-economic, and social-ecological context within which that event is experienced (Young, 2004). This was evident in a recent study on collective trauma in the Guinean Languette region that documented a relationship between rates of distress and variation in local community narratives of violence and cultural decimation or resilience (Abramowitz, 2005).Historical Trauma as Public Narrative By conceptualizing historical trauma as a public narrative we are focusing on narrative accounts that link past experiences of traumatization by a group or community to health over time. Narratives of past traumas and group health over time can be found throughout the world and in reference to a wide diversity of mass-experienced trauma, from a single event, such as a natural disaster (Cox & Perry, 2011), to a recurrent history of oppression and traumatization (Evans-Campbell, 2008). In the latter case, it may be most fruitful to discuss historical trauma in terms of repeated and linked injustices and traumas, some of which date back centuries and others occurring in the present day. Importantly, historical trauma narratives will also vary by person and culture, just as memory and trauma vary across people and cultures (Antze & Lambek, 1996; Young, 1997), and be influenced by the contexts of both local and dominant cultural rules of discourse (Foucault, 2003). This relationship between history, memory, and contemporary contexts highlights the dual nature of historical trauma—on the one hand, historical trauma refers to events and experiences that many people consider traumatic; on the other hand, these events are carried forward through public narratives that not only recount the events but individual and collective responses to them (Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Crawford, 2013; Evans-Campbell, 2008). Although we view historical trauma as narrative, it is important to recognize that these narratives are tied to real injustices or disasters. A narrative conceptualization does not deny the veracity of past traumatic events, but rather redirects one’s focus on how those events are represented and linked to health outcomes today. In this way, historical trauma consists of public narratives that link traumatic events in the historic past to contemporary local contexts so that the trauma becomes part of the contemporary cultural narrative. For example, whereas the fact of boarding schools existence in the history of Native Americans is undisputed, a contemporary narrative explains that the forced removal of children from their families caused the loss of traditional parenting practices among many communities and families, thereby harming the parenting ability of subsequent generations which partially explains behavioral health disparities (Evans-Campbell, Walters, Pearson, & Campbell, 2012). Similarly, without disputing the veracity of the Jewish Holocaust or Palestinian Nakba, we can identify contemporary historical trauma narratives that link these past injustices to present-day social and health conditions—each cultural group views the Holocaust or the Nakba respectively as a great tragedy to befall their people with continued ramifications in contemporary life (Barel et al., 2010; Masalha, 2008). The ways in which people and cultures represent and respond to past traumas become more central than an examination of the facts when we consider historical trauma as narrative. Understanding historical trauma as a public narrative thus reframes the discussion of historical trauma from a search for\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the collective emotional and psychological harm experienced by a group due to traumatic events in their past, which can affect health outcomes over time.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARMENIANS<|>PERSON<|>Armenians are an ethnic group that has experienced historical trauma due to the massacres by Turks during the Ottoman Empire, which they seek to have recognized as genocide.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKS<|>PERSON<|>Turks are the ethnic group associated with the Ottoman Empire, which is historically linked to the massacres of Armenians.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE AMERICANS<|>PERSON<|>Native Americans are the indigenous peoples of the Americas who have experienced historical trauma, particularly through events such as the forced removal of children from their families.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEWISH HOLOCAUST<|>EVENT<|>The Jewish Holocaust was a genocide during World War II in which six million Jews were killed, leading to significant historical trauma for the Jewish people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PALESTINIAN NAKBA<|>EVENT<|>The Palestinian Nakba refers to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which is viewed as a historical trauma by the Palestinian people.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUINEAN LANGETTE REGION<|>GEO<|>The Guinean Languette region is an area that has documented collective trauma related to violence and cultural decimation.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARMENIANS<|>TURKS<|>Armenians seek recognition of the massacres committed by Turks during the Ottoman Empire as genocide, linking their historical trauma to the actions of Turks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE AMERICANS<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The historical trauma experienced by Native Americans is linked to the forced removal of children from their families, affecting their parenting practices and health outcomes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEWISH HOLOCAUST<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Jewish Holocaust is a significant historical trauma that continues to impact the Jewish community today<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PALESTINIAN NAKBA<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Palestinian Nakba is a historical trauma that has lasting effects on the Palestinian people and their social and health conditions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUINEAN LANGETTE REGION<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>The Guinean Languette region has experienced collective trauma linked to violence, which is a manifestation of historical trauma<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
