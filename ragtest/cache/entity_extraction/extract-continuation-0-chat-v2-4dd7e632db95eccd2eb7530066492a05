However, there is growing evidence for integrative treatment approaches and relationally focused interventions as effective treatments for DTD [e.g., (4, 199)]. Two such approaches include the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency (ARC) model and dyadic-developmental psychotherapy, which include individual and family counseling sessions designed to enhance interpersonal communication, attachment security, and emotion regulation, and co-regulation between the parent and child; (200, 201). Concerning adolescents and adults with trauma, findings from recent systematic investigations and meta-analyses (202–204) suggest that a combination of psychotherapy (e.g., Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy) and antidepressant medication (205) are beneficial. However, more studies are needed as treatment effects were heterogeneous. Likewise, more studies are required to establish the long-term efficacy and risk-to-benefit tradeoff for the use of antipsychotic agents (risperidone, quetiapine), especially for children and adolescents, as well as anticonvulsant drugs (206), which are limited in use due to their side effects.Conclusions and future directions While developmental trauma is commonly linked to PTSD, the DTD diagnosis captures a more chronic and pervasive form of trauma represented by a constellation of complex and interacting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms beyond that of PTSD alone. Several studies suggest that children, adolescents, and adults with DTD display a broad range of mental health symptom profiles [e.g., (30, 31, 178, 207, 208)]. These individuals demonstrate significant problems in many areas of their lives, but without accurate assessment, advocacy, and treatment, they may live in mental anguish, vacillating between self-injury, suicidal and antisocial behaviors, and a significant inability to cope with reality and enhance their strengths and resiliencies. The DTD diagnosis offers clinicians the opportunity to more comprehensively account for the multitude of what might otherwise be viewed as divergent symptoms and discrete mental health disorders. The DTD diagnosis offers an all-encompassing conceptualization, within a single diagnostic, developmental syndrome, of the many different symptoms that may be experienced as a result of early trauma. The diagnosis may help limit the over-pathologizing of these individuals (i.e., they would receive a single diagnosis to capture their broad array of symptoms as opposed to three or more disparate diagnoses). More importantly, utilization of the DTD framework may increase the likelihood of more accurate assessment; appropriate symptom management; well-aligned, effective treatments; and better short- and long-term outcomes. Recognition of complex trauma may provide insights that could enhance the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis for these individuals and, at the same time, build or enhance their strengths (which are likely to be undermined if a positive psychology framework does not balance a traditional, deficit-driven approach). Application of the DTD diagnosis may help decrease inappropriate and inadequate treatment approaches by using multi-system and multidisciplinary approaches when working with individuals who have suffered repeated and severe early abuse. Consistent with Bronfenbrenner's theoretical model, an appreciation of the pervasiveness and range of opportunities to reverse the adverse effects of DTD would allow for additional, coordinated efforts among educational, legal, medical, and political leaders and stakeholders. This type of understanding will be required for substantive change to occur for individuals diagnosed with this disorder. At the organizational level, systems must promote formal policies that acknowledge, respect, and de-stigmatize DTD. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Trauma-Informed Approach, this can be accomplished by engendering principles of neurodiversity, implementing social justice frameworks, and acknowledging the multiplicity of trauma associated with various minority statuses (209). Recommended system-wide policies and procedures include enhanced and coordinated evaluation protocols, formal response training, long-term care initiatives, and community engagement aimed at recognizing, supporting, and treating those with DTD (210–212). In sum, research studies have established that developmental trauma confers significant risks to the health and wellbeing of those who have experienced early, repeated interpersonal traumas. Disturbances in attachment, emotion regulation, self-perception, and worldview assumptions are precipitated by trauma and cause a broad range of correlated psychological and medical disorders. Future studies are needed to reconcile several outstanding questions related to ACEs. For example, psychometric investigations of individuals who have experienced ACEs raise the possibility that additional typologies may be present [e.g., borderline personality and resilient subgroupings; (66, 213)]. Another avenue for research concerns the possibility that complex trauma is correlated with multiple sensitive periods, particularly for individuals who have been subjected to prolonged violence exposure. Lastly, although ACEs have been widely studied and consistently predict traumatic responses in adults, the construct encompasses a broad range of adversities, such as parent divorce, sexual assault, and neglect, which may confer different traumatic adaptations.Author contributions DC was responsible for the conceptualization, organization, and final draft of the manuscript.
