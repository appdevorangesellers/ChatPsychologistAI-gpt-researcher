Historical trauma that results from colonization may lead to diminished cultural continuity, which may lead to limited collective action to preserve and advance a cultural legacy (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009). Conversely, narratives of continuity and cultural revitalization promote resiliency (Kirmayer, Dandeneau, Marshall, Phillips, & Williamson, 2011). Strong cultural identity may be emblematic of public resilience in the face of historical trauma (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013). For example, Taylor and Usborne (2010) argue that reconstruction of a strong cultural identity following collective trauma, such as war or disaster, is critical in subsequent individual and community well-being. Their research has shown that clarity in one’s cultural identity predicts personal well-being and that clarity in one’s self-concept mediates this relationship across diverse cultures (Usborne & Taylor, 2010). Furthermore, cultural identity represents the interaction between public norms and self-concept readily expressed in narratives (Gone, Miller, & Rappaport, 1999). International research demonstrates that, across many cultures, family and community narratives contextualize an intergenerational self-concept that serves an important protective role, such as for adolescents (Fivush, Habermas, Waters, & Zaman, 2011) or among marginalized groups who may face daily discrimination (Wexler et al., 2009). Denham (2008) and Crawford (2013) both emphasize how for indigenous people in North America family narratives of historical trauma play a central role in how children situate themselves with respect to adversity and resilience.A Narrative Model for Understanding the Impact of Historical Trauma on Health Figure 1 presents a narrative model that specifies how public narratives of historical trauma impact health. As shown, the model specifies successive recursive stages beginning with public narratives of historical trauma that frame contemporary reminders of past collective trauma for a particular group or community. These contemporary reminders influence how salient the narrative is to a person or group; conversely, the salience of the narrative to the individual is critical in determining whether an experience will be interpreted as a reminder of historical trauma(s) or not. Narrative salience also influences whether the narrative will have health implications. Similarly, health status influences the salience of historical trauma narratives; for example, if a person struggles with health outcomes that are attributed to a public narrative of historical trauma, then that narrative is more likely to be seen as relevant to one’s life. Our narrative model of historical trauma is heuristic in that it emphasizes the possible recursive influences between historical trauma narratives, contemporary reminders of that trauma, narrative salience of the trauma within personal and public contexts, and health impacts. We provide a brief description of each component of the model below. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Narrative Model of How Historical Trauma Impacts Health: Public narratives connect historical traumas to health impacts through public and personal contemporary reminders and the degree of narrative salience. Each stage of the narrative model is recursively influential of the connecting stages.Historical Trauma Narratives The left side of Figure 1 depicts historical trauma narratives, that is, public narratives that are present-day, culturally-constructed accounts for a particular group. These narratives link the historical past through meaning-making to contemporary circumstances (Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013) as depicted in subsequent stages in the model. Following from Wertsch (2008), these stories shape the collective memories of group traumas in the sense that they are stories collectively told, received, interpreted, and re-told—historical trauma narratives are the mechanisms by which memories of historical traumas are shaped and conveyed.Contemporary Reminders of Historical Trauma A strict definition of narrative requires a narrator telling the story; however, narratives as such are not the only mechanism by which information on historical traumas are communicated. For example, photography provides powerful visual representations that can serve as reminders of past atrocities (Sontag, 2003). Such contemporary reminders contextualize one’s lived-experience and interpretation of historical traumas. Research with children in Russia showed that situational reminders of trauma, such as walking past shelled buildings or encountering memorials at school, were found to be the greatest source of distress for the children (Scrimin et al., 2011). Similarly, Layne et al. (2010) identified general trauma reminders, such as the news, as the strongest mediator between war trauma exposure and PTSD and functional impairment among Bosnian children. Whitbeck, Adams et al.’s (2004) measure of historical loss exemplifies this process within the context of historical trauma, whereby contemporary contexts and experiences provide reminders of the historical losses. Conversely, reburial ceremonies serve as public symbols that not only highlight the past trauma, but may also promote healing and resilience (Eppel, 2002; Honwana, 1997; Pollack, 2003). Similar to Scrimin et al.’s (2011) distinction between external (e.g., situational and media) and internal (e.g., bodily sensations and affective states) reminders, we divide historical trauma reminders into public and personal reminders. Public reminders are publically available or experienced events, symbols, contexts, systems, and structures that serve to remind people of historical trauma narratives, such as a new event similar to the past traumatic events, media-portrayed stereotypes, lack of resources, contaminated living environments, and pervasive poverty. Aboriginal reservations and decaying urban environments are examples of structural and physical contexts that can provide daily reminders of historic processes of loss, marginalization, discrimination, and trauma: “An empty city lot is not just the rubble of a razed building, but\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INDIGENOUS CANADIAN COMMUNITIES<|>GEO<|>Indigenous Canadian communities engage in actions that symbolize their cultural identity and act as a protective factor against behavioral health problems.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>EVENT<|>Cultural identity represents the interaction between public norms and self-concept, which is expressed in narratives and is crucial for community resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>EVENT<|>Historical trauma refers to the collective emotional and psychological injury over generations resulting from traumatic events, such as colonization.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CULTURAL REVITALIZATION<|>EVENT<|>Cultural revitalization involves efforts to preserve and advance a cultural legacy, promoting resilience among communities.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>EVENT<|>A narrative model that specifies how public narratives of historical trauma impact health and community well-being.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REBURIAL CEREMONIES<|>EVENT<|>Reburial ceremonies serve as public symbols that highlight past trauma and promote healing and resilience.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAMILY NARRATIVES<|>EVENT<|>Family narratives contextualize an intergenerational self-concept that serves an important protective role for individuals, especially adolescents.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIGENOUS CANADIAN COMMUNITIES<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>Indigenous Canadian communities' actions symbolize their cultural identity, which is crucial for their resilience against historical trauma.<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>CULTURAL REVITALIZATION<|>Efforts in cultural revitalization are responses to the impacts of historical trauma, aiming to restore cultural identity and community strength.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL IDENTITY<|>NARRATIVE MODEL<|>The narrative model illustrates how cultural identity is shaped by public narratives of historical trauma, influencing community well-being.<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISTORICAL TRAUMA<|>FAMILY NARRATIVES<|>Family narratives of historical trauma play a central role in how individuals situate themselves with respect to adversity and resilience.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CULTURAL REVITALIZATION<|>REBURIAL CEREMONIES<|>Reburial ceremonies are a form of cultural revitalization that highlights past traumas while promoting healing within communities.<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
