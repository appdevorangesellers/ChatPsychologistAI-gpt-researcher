DSM-5 specifiers for intellectual disability (mild, moderate, severe, and profound) have not changed from DSM-IV. DSM-5 provides a table and examples of deficits listed in three domains of adaptive functioning: conceptual (academic), social, and practical. These domains all have implications for forensic evaluators. For example, adults with mild intellectual disability may have conceptual deficits in abstract reasoning, managing money, executive functioning, and short-term memory. They may have a limited capacity to appreciate risk in social situations and may be more gullible than their same-age peers. They may also need help with practical skills, such as making health care and legal decisions and performing a skilled job competently. DSM-5 stresses the importance of norming tests to account for cultural variances and an examinee's native language. This may be an important consideration for forensic psychiatrists who consult in cases involving immigrants where a diagnosis of intellectual disability is being considered or applied, such as a disability claim or a petition for a workplace accommodation. Some individuals may malinger intellectual disability disorder to avoid legal consequences. It may be more challenging to detect malingering in an individual who is from a culture or who speaks a language with which the forensic mental health professional is not familiar. DSM-5 also describes the circumstances under which a child who has been diagnosed with intellectual disability benefits from interventions that significantly improve adaptive functioning, “such that the diagnosis of Intellectual Disability is no longer appropriate” (Ref. 1, p 39). At times, this change will result in lively debate among forensic mental health professionals in courtrooms and elsewhere, especially when intellectual disability disorder is tendered as a basis for adjudicative incompetence or a bar to capital sentencing. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court determined in Atkins v. Virginia20 that individuals with mental retardation cannot be executed. In that case, the condition was vaguely described as intellectual functioning in the subaverage range: roughly below IQ 70 and deficits in social and practical functioning with an onset before age 18.21 New definitions of intellectual disability in DSM-5 may provide guidance as mental health experts and the Supreme Court grapple with this difficult forensic matter. The clinical validity of intellectual disability disorder may also be debated by forensic mental health experts when an individual seems to meet diagnostic criteria in the absence of supporting documentation from the neurodevelopmental period. The absence of such information is particularly important when forensic psychiatrists evaluate institutionalized adults who demonstrate obvious intellectual impairment and deficits in adaptive functioning and who lack supporting educational and medical documentation to affirm the diagnosis. DSM-5's emphasis on clinical impression and adaptive functioning in the diagnosis of intellectual disability disorder is likely to increase forensic psychiatry's role in courtroom testimony regarding affected and allegedly affected individuals. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: A New Childhood Disorder One of the most significant additions to DSM-5 diagnoses is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new mood disorder classified in the depressive disorders section but exclusive to children and adolescents. This disorder may be identified in individuals who have persistent irritability or anger and recurrent episodes (on average three times per week) of developmentally inappropriate verbal or behavioral dyscontrol. The symptoms start before age 10 years, the diagnosis is made between ages 6 and 18, and the disorder causes significant impairment. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was introduced due to “considerable concern” (Ref. 1, p 157) that some children with this symptom profile are overdiagnosed with and treated for bipolar disorder. However, researchers who study bipolar disorder in children and adolescents found that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder could not be distinguished from oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder and lacked substantial diagnostic stability.17,22 In addition, some in the research community questioned the diagnostic utility of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in clinical populations.22,23 The initial diagnostic criteria proposed for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder were revised, perhaps in response to these concerns, to improve the utility and validity of the diagnosis. The resultant criteria more clearly distinguished disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder. Individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have persistent symptoms, whereas youths with bipolar disorder have discrete episodes of mania or hypomania. In other words, the duration of mood symptoms is the benchmark that distinguishes the two disorders. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are more likely to develop unipolar depressive disorders and anxiety disorders and thus should be treated if they are depressed, not manic or psychotic.24,–,26 The change in treatment protocol may reduce the frequency of prescribing atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium, and other medications for bipolar disorder in children, thereby improving treatment response rates and reducing the risk of more serious medication side effects. Treating youths with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also reduce the likelihood that, in the event of a first psychotic and/or manic episode, medications that are used to treat these disorders will obfuscate their clinical presentation. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will play a significant role in child forensic psychiatry, especially where at-risk and justice-involved youths are concerned. A subgroup of individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are caught up in the juvenile justice system because of allegations of domestic violence, assault, and resisting arrest, among other offenses. Early identification and treatment of these youths with antidepressants and other interventions may contain their behavior and delay the onset or reduce the frequency of involvement with the judicial system, by raising the threshold beyond which they become aggressive.
