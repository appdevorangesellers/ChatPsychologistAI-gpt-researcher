We also believe that narrative methods are essential to documenting the processes that link public narratives of historical trauma to health outcomes, including experiences of contemporary reminders and the salience given to specific narratives. However, we also believe that a range of mixed methods (Tebes, 2012) are essential to confirm, elucidate, or alter stages described in the model. Research with specific cultural groups is also critical to indentify locally relevant reminders that serve as mediators and moderators of health outcomes, such a sense of historical loss (Whitbeck, Adams, et al., 2004). It is also critical to consider historical trauma as a potential source of both distress and resilience. Research should seek to disentangle how, for whom, when, and where positive sequelae can develop following mass trauma exposure. By studying contemporary experiences of mass trauma and the public narratives that communities generate following trauma, we can better understand how to address historical trauma narratives to enhance community health. In particular, consideration of historical trauma narratives requires attention to the social ecology of history, trauma, and identity for a given population. Historical trauma narratives most likely vary in individual, family, community, and dominant cultural narratives. Disentangling how these differences influence individual and community health is crucial to identifying intervention strategies to promote resilience within the context of historical trauma.\nFinally, we believe the narrative model of historical trauma proposed addresses a number of weaknesses of existing historical trauma theories. Green and Darity (2010) warn that current theories of historical trauma fail to account for the effects of daily indignities and make problematic assumptions about marginalized populations. Our proposed model effectively addresses these issues through its emphasis on contemporary reminders and its focus on personal and public salience. The model also provides a basis for understanding individual and community level differences in health outcomes following trauma, since historical traumas are represented differently across individuals, families, populations, and contexts. A narrative approach addresses this concern by requiring careful consideration of individual and collective stories and their integration with contemporary cultural representations and contexts.\nAppadurai (2004) posits that culture, and by extension cultural identity, not only refers to past traditions and present norms, but also to a future-oriented capacity to aspire. Public narratives frame how we feel about the world and either inspire action or, as with hopelessness, inhibit it (Ganz, 2011). For cultural groups with significant shared histories of trauma and who experience present-day marginalization, such as many indigenous peoples across the world, a narrative of historical trauma may be a highly salient factor that sustains emotional and psychological wounds, thus functioning as a cultural narrative that inhibits psychological growth and collective aspiration (Chandler & Lalonde, 2009; Crawford, 2013; Gone, 2013). In contrast, historical trauma narratives may also sustain resiliency in response to the ongoing oppression or wounding, as evidenced by family histories of survival (Denham, 2008). The model proposed here provides a means for examining systematically the conditions under which each of these health outcomes are likely to occur; that is, for identifying how historical trauma can have lasting and damaging impacts on health but also be the nexus of group- or community-wide transformation and resilience.\nHistorical trauma is a promising but inadequately conceptualized area of research.\nHistorical trauma is a promising but inadequately conceptualized area of research.\nA wide variety of research shows the short- and long-term health impact of trauma.\nA wide variety of research shows the short- and long-term health impact of trauma.\nHistorical trauma functions a public narrative for particular groups or communities.\nHistorical trauma functions a public narrative for particular groups or communities.\nWe offer a model of historical trauma as present-day narrative that impacts health.\nWe offer a model of historical trauma as present-day narrative that impacts health.\nHistorical trauma narratives are a source of present-day distress and resilience.\nHistorical trauma narratives are a source of present-day distress and resilience.\nThis work was funded, in part, by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) postdoctoral training program in substance abuse prevention research (T32 DA 019426) to the senior author in support of the lead author, and a Yale Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health (BIRCWH) Scholar program award (K12HD066065) in support of the second author.
