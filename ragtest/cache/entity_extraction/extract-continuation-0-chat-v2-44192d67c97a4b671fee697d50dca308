These traumatic stress adaptations, in turn, can contribute to experiences of emotional numbing and low frustration tolerance and precipitate behavioral outbursts that result in refractory (treatment-resistant) mood disturbances, long-term psychiatric hospitalizations (and re-hospitalizations), removal from school, and placement in foster care and juvenile justice treatment centers (89–93). The DSM-5 indicates that the sequelae of “prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e.g., child abuse)” include symptoms that are consistent with DTD: “difficulties in regulating emotions or maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms” (p. 276). However, there is vigorous debate regarding the viability of this alternative designation, given that the criteria for other specified trauma and stress-related disorders are broad, lack specificity, include interpersonal and non-interpersonal antecedents, and require that providers first consider alternative-mainstream taxonomies. For example, DTD must be differentiated from PTSD, reactive and disinhibited attachment disturbances, and borderline personality disorder, the latter of which is marked by pervasive mood instability, impaired self-identity, dissociation, and provocative and confrontational interpersonal behaviors [often at extremes of the idealization and devaluation continuum; (60, 66, 68, 94)]. As such, several different approaches are used to diagnose persons who have experienced early, recurring stressors and are displaying indications of developmental trauma disorder.Developmental trauma: Diagnostic issues Researchers have developed objective procedures to diagnose children with indications of DTD (e.g., standardized interviews and psychometric instruments specifically designed to assess for trauma-mediated interpersonal and attachment disturbances). The Developmental Trauma Disorder - Semi-structured Interview (DTD-SI) is one such tool. DTD expert consensus guidelines and psychometric studies on the validity and reliability of the DTD criteria and the DTD-SI suggest that three factors differentiate DTD from other psychiatric disorders, including PTSD (24, 28, 34, 95, 96). These factors include emotion and physiological dysregulation (e.g., alexithymia, sensitivity to touch, functional neurological disorders), cognitive processing and behavioral problems (e.g., traumatic re-enactments, self-mutilation, dissociation, impaired attention, learning, memory), and poor self-other awareness (characterized by low self-esteem and self-hatred, insecure attachment, experiences of interpersonal betrayal and persistent states of anger, resentment, and revenge). PTSD preschool adaptation Another approach to diagnosing children with trauma, especially for those who fail to meet the criteria for PTSD, is to revise the requirements of the DSM so that it is more developmentally sensitive to children. The American Psychiatric Association conferred a preschool subtype PTSD diagnosis for children between the ages of 0–6, as an alternative to the standard PTSD classification that originated from work with adults (3). The alternative set of criteria used for the preschool subtype PTSD includes several changes to the standard DSM PTSD criteria, ranging from adjustments to clinical thresholds (e.g., lowered from three to one avoidance symptom) to the removal of items deemed inappropriate for children (e.g., expression of immediate distress following the trauma; nightmares that necessarily include traumatic content; a sense of a foreshortened future, which requires complex cognitive skills). DSM-5 criteria for the preschool PTSD subtype require that the “duration of the disturbance [referring to trauma symptoms] is more than 1 month” (3, p. 273). The DSM preschool subtype is also more developmentally sensitive to children in that it emphasizes symptoms of trauma that are unique to younger individuals (e.g., traumatic reenactments in interactions with peers during playtime) and focuses more on trauma that is particularly relevant for children, such as harm to the wellbeing of caregivers or disruptions to the quality of the parent-child relationship (e.g., having a caregiver who is medically ill and unable to care for the child, foster care placement, loss of a primary caregiver). These revised criteria were designed with both assessment and treatment in mind, underscoring the recognition that symptoms of PTSD may naturally present themselves in children's play behaviors and not necessarily in their verbal responses to the myriad of questions posed by assessors in standard clinical interviews. This revised DSM-5 taxonomy conceptualizes children with trauma as a single (or homogenous) group. In other words, it implies that children with trauma differ from adults with trauma and, at the same time, that they reliably differ from children who have not experienced trauma (or do not present with clinical symptoms as a result of trauma). Studies suggest that providers can identify and treat traumatized children more effectively using this revised classification (97–99).The development of DTD: Bronfenbrenner's multiple levels of analysis framework As a multifactorial neurobehavioral disturbance, developmental trauma causes significant alterations to children's cognitive, emotional, physiological, and relational capacities, and as a result, they experience widespread disruptions to their academic, social, and occupational functioning (100–102). At the same time, mental health disturbances linked to the development of trauma are mediated and/or moderated by a broad range of factors, all of which have the potential to mitigate the longitudinal course of developmental trauma, associated psychiatric comorbidities, and functional impairments. This notion is supported by Bronfenbrenner's Socio-Ecological Model [SEM; (103)], which asserts that multiple levels of influence, specifically individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policies, are needed to understand the diverse range of adaptations associated with interpersonal trauma, in that they can confer additive risks or, conversely, potentiate positive and resilient transformations in response to adverse childhood experiences. The physiological, attachment, and meta-cognitive disturbances seen in traumatized children intersect at multiple levels of Bronfenbrenner's model.
