Panel data constructed from the 2009 to 2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and\nits Transition to Adulthood (TA) supplement are used in this study. The multinomial logistic regression analysis\nfindings showed that the amount of revolving debt was negatively associated with young adultsâ€™ mental health.\nOn the other hand, perceived abilities in acting responsibly, in solving problems, and in managing money were\npositively associated with the mental health of young adults. The fixed effects regression analysis results indicate\nthat the amounts of credit card and student loan debt from the previous period were negatively associated with\nan increase in the mental health continuum scores of young adults over time. A discussion of the implications of\nthis studyâ€™s key findings for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners is included.\nKeywords:\nI\nD\n:\nt\ni\n0\n0\n1\n5\ndebt\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n0\n7\n0\n, financial well-being, flourishing, mental health, young adults\nS\ntudent loan and credit card debt burdens among\nyoung adults in the United States have increased in\nthe past two decades. With the rise in education costs\nand stagnant government grants, the student loan burden has\nincreased substantially (Cilluffo, 2017; Davidson, 2017).\nMore than 35 million Americans are currently paying stu-\ndent loan debt (Williams, 2014). The rapid growth of debt\namong young people has drawn the attention of researchers,\neducators, and policymakers. Student loan debt has a nega-\ntive effect on household savings and increases householdsâ€™\nprobability of delinquency of debts and bankruptcy, thus\naffecting their financial well-being over time (Elliot & Nam,\n2013; Rothstein & Rouse, 2011). Student loan debt has also\nbeen associated with a delay in decisions to marry or have\na child (Gicheva, 2016; Velez et al., 2019). Furthermore,\nhigher debt for young people has been associated with worse\nhealth outcomes (Dugan & Kafka, 2014; Kim & Chatterjee,\n2019).\nIn\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n0\n8\n0\naddition to student loan debt, high unsecured debt, such\nas credit card debt, is also found to affect the well-being of\nhouseholds negatively. People use unsecured debt to pur-\nchase goods and services and take on unsecured debt at\nhigher interest to supplement the unexpected shortfall in\ntheir regular income (Dwyer, 2018; Houle & Berger, 2017).\nHodson et al. (2014) found that transitioning young adults\nperceive unsecured debt as an investment, and they perceive\ntheir ability to accrue debt as empowering, and although\nunsecured debt has a positive association with the percep-\ntion of well-being for young adults in the short run if an\nunpaid, unsecured debt can have an adverse effect on peo-\nplesâ€™ mental health over the long term. Consistent with this,\nSun and Houleâ€™s (2018) study found that higher levels of\nunsecured debt were associated with negative mental health\noutcomes over time.\nThe\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n0\n8\n5\nhigher debt was associated with worse mental and\nphysical health (Sweet et al., 2013). Some argue that the\nmore student loans people have, the worse their mental\nhealth outcomes will be (Williams, 2014). Unsecured debt\ncan adversely affect self-esteem and general self-efficacy\n(Dwyer et al., 2011), lower young adultsâ€™ perceived well-\nbeing (Zhang & Kemp, 2009), and lead to less frequent\nvolunteerism (Stevenson, 2008) and academic behavior\n(Hogan et al., 2013). Financial strain from debts is associ-\nated with anxiety, depression, and lower physical health in\na\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n0\n5\n5\nProfessor, Department of Family Science, School of Public Health University of Maryland, 1142 School of Public Health, College Park, MD 20742.\nE-mail: jinkim@umd.edu\nb\nI\nD\n:\np\n0\n0\n6\n0\nProfessor, Department of Financial Planning, Housing and Consumer Economics, University of Georgia, 205 Dawson Hall, 305 Sanford Dr, Athens, GA\n30622.
