These revised criteria were designed with both assessment and treatment in mind, underscoring the recognition that symptoms of PTSD may naturally present themselves in children's play behaviors and not necessarily in their verbal responses to the myriad of questions posed by assessors in standard clinical interviews. This revised DSM-5 taxonomy conceptualizes children with trauma as a single (or homogenous) group. In other words, it implies that children with trauma differ from adults with trauma and, at the same time, that they reliably differ from children who have not experienced trauma (or do not present with clinical symptoms as a result of trauma). Studies suggest that providers can identify and treat traumatized children more effectively using this revised classification (97–99).The development of DTD: Bronfenbrenner's multiple levels of analysis framework As a multifactorial neurobehavioral disturbance, developmental trauma causes significant alterations to children's cognitive, emotional, physiological, and relational capacities, and as a result, they experience widespread disruptions to their academic, social, and occupational functioning (100–102). At the same time, mental health disturbances linked to the development of trauma are mediated and/or moderated by a broad range of factors, all of which have the potential to mitigate the longitudinal course of developmental trauma, associated psychiatric comorbidities, and functional impairments. This notion is supported by Bronfenbrenner's Socio-Ecological Model [SEM; (103)], which asserts that multiple levels of influence, specifically individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policies, are needed to understand the diverse range of adaptations associated with interpersonal trauma, in that they can confer additive risks or, conversely, potentiate positive and resilient transformations in response to adverse childhood experiences. The physiological, attachment, and meta-cognitive disturbances seen in traumatized children intersect at multiple levels of Bronfenbrenner's model. More specifically, children and adolescents who have experienced severe trauma and ACEs experience high rates of poverty, legal problems, and violence exposure (89, 104–106). Abusive parents often have experienced their own traumas and attachment disturbances (107–109), which are often compounded by high rates of substance abuse, depression, financial stress, and unemployment (12, 110–113). Racial, ethnic, sexual, and neurodiverse minorities are affected by developmental trauma at very high rates (114, 115), suggesting that systemic factors such as state and national policies, allocation of resources for prevention and intervention, discrimination, and stigma exert influence over, and significantly impact responses to, trauma and recovery. Children with trauma live in persistent states of fear and terror, and recurring traumas become transformative developmental experiences that alter their global appraisals and future responses to stress (14, 49, 61, 116). This heightened fear propensity disrupts self-awareness, information processing, interpersonal communication, and mastery of age-appropriate developmental competencies [e.g., establishing healthy relationship parameters, identifying and expressing feelings appropriately, and tolerating ambiguity; (43, 90)] and causes individuals to have problems learning, making friends at school, and appreciating their strengths and unique abilities, which are often overshadowed by their social and behavioral difficulties. Researchers have described several adverse physiological alterations underlying cognitive disturbances in children who have experienced early traumas (13, 117–124). These include, for example, stress-mediated changes to the organization and functioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, which exert influence over fear processing, including automatic (impulsive) behavioral responses to perceived threats (125–130), learning and memory [fear memories override attention, concentration, and, in turn, inhibit learning of new information; (72, 131, 132)], and higher-order (complex) cognitive operations [e.g., problem-solving and learning from experience, stress appraisal and reappraisal, perceived controllability; (133–135)]. As an illustration of this, reinforcement and contingency learning studies indicate that children who had experienced severe adversity or developmental trauma are not able to adjust their behavior effectively to shifting environments or demands, regardless of threatening and non-threatening circumstances (136, 137). These findings suggest that individuals who have endured significant stress in their lives, especially during early childhood or adolescence, are at increased risk of experiencing avoidance, anger, frustration, and anxiety as primary ways of being in the world, regardless of their circumstances (138–140). These types of responses can be damaging to an individual's development and ability to function, particularly if their safety needs are undermined. Repeatedly traumatized children and adolescents become habituated to evaluating their surroundings for indications of threat that might render them vulnerable to additional traumas, given that they had limited opportunities to recover from the early and repeated abuse and neglect. Researchers speculate that the mechanisms involved in the development of traumatic stress adaptations correlate with diverse, interrelated psychiatric symptoms and comorbidities often reported in studies of individuals who have experienced repeated abuse and neglect. This notion is consistent with a socio-ecological framework, the developmental trauma diagnosis, and trans-theoretical models that focus on far-reaching (cross-diagnostic) effects from critical and sensitive periods, attachment and social cognition (e.g., mentalizing and perspective taking), sleep, physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and mood and personality (141–143). The role of attachment Prolonged and cumulative interpersonal trauma disrupts the development of secure attachments to caregivers. According to attachment theorists, securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregivers to minimize anxiety and to form goal-directed partnerships, and/or interactional synchrony, where they mirror each other's communication patterns and learn to anticipate, express, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
