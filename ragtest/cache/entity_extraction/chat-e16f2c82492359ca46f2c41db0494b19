These included stressors related to interpersonal issues (e.g., fighting with one’s romantic partner; not receiving an invitation to a party), school (e.g., failing an important test), finances (e.g., trying to get a loan), and physical illness (e.g., becoming ill with mononucleosis).\nThe clinicians were tasked with identifying, for patients facing the above stressful situations, the best emotion regulation strategy from the following list:\nAcceptance (e.g., of emotions or situations), distraction, hiding one’s feelings, expressing one’s emotions, gathering additional information, trying to improve the relationship (e.g., spending quality time together), leaving the unpleasant situation, problem-solving, seeking support and advice, and reappraisal (e.g., viewing oneself or the situation in a less stress-inducing way).\nSubsequently, the therapists were required to rate the effectiveness of each strategy in helping patients feel better (from zero, meaning not effective at all, to 100, meaning extremely effective).\nBest Emotion Regulation Strategies: Findings\nThe results showed none of the strategies was rated as most effective in all situations.\nHowever, some strategies were more likely than others to be rated as effective across different situations. Specifically, therapists, regardless of orientation, agreed that problem-solving was generally the best emotion regulation strategy, whereas concealing emotions was the least effective emotion regulation strategy.\nSee Table 1, for the full ranking of emotion regulation techniques, from most effective to least.\nSource: Arash Emamzadeh (adapted from Southward et al., 2021)\nSource: Arash Emamzadeh (adapted from Southward et al., 2021)\nSource: Arash Emamzadeh (adapted from Southward et al., 2021)\nSource: Arash Emamzadeh (adapted from Southward et al., 2021)\nThe findings regarding problem-solving (i.e., it being a highly effective emotion regulation technique) agree with previous research. For instance, a 2010 meta-analysis of emotion regulation strategies found the regular use of problem-solving had the largest negative association (r = − 0.31) with mental illness; in contrast, emotional suppression, which overlaps with the concept of concealing one’s emotions, was positively associated with mental illness (r = 0.34).\nTHE BASICS What Is Emotion Regulation? Take our Emotional Intelligence Test Find a therapist near me\nWhat Is Emotion Regulation?\nTake our Emotional Intelligence Test\nFind a therapist near me\nEmotion Regulation and Problem-Solving\nLet us end with a brief review of problem-solving, which, as noted above, is considered a highly effective emotion regulation strategy for managing stressful situations.\nProblem-solving is an active and goal-oriented approach to dealing with stress. It involves trying to modify the situation or its consequences (as opposed to modifying the unpleasant emotions experienced in the situation).\nProblem-solving involves the following:\nDefining the problem and the goal, identifying the obstacles to the goal, brainstorming potential solutions to overcome the obstacles, evaluating the potential solutions, choosing the least costly and most beneficial solution, implementing the solution, and evaluating the results.\nDefining the problem is an important initial step because real-life problems are often complicated—involving thoughts, emotions, values, attitudes, and actions of one or more people.\nEmotion Regulation Essential Reads An 8 Step Roadmap for Managing Difficult Feelings Do You Have a Regulation Partner?\nEmotion Regulation Essential Reads\nAn 8 Step Roadmap for Managing Difficult Feelings Do You Have a Regulation Partner?\nAn 8 Step Roadmap for Managing Difficult Feelings\nAn 8 Step Roadmap for Managing Difficult Feelings\nDo You Have a Regulation Partner?\nDo You Have a Regulation Partner?\nLet us consider an example.\nSuppose a friend says, “I feel sad because I rarely get to spend quality time with my teenager.” You can probably identify the problem and the person’s goal from their statement alone. To solve the problem, the individual would need to consider various obstacles to the goal of spending quality time with their teen—obstacles like fatigue, conflicting schedules, or communication issues. Subsequently, they will need to brainstorm solutions (e.g., read a book on communicating with teens, go on a camping trip with their teenager), choose and implement one of these solutions, and evaluate whether the solution worked as expected.\nIn general, is important to be as specific as possible when defining the problem and goal, be creative when brainstorming potential solutions, and be realistic regarding one’s expectations (but remain optimistic if a solution does not work).\nTo become a great problem-solver and to cope successfully with different situations, use problem-solving techniques regularly and develop a problem-solving mindset. So try to become more curious. Make friends with uncertainty (that is where possibilities and opportunities exist). And do not give up.\nShare Tweet Share Email\nShare Tweet Share Email\nAbout the Author Arash Emamzadeh attended the University of British Columbia in Canada, where he studied genetics and psychology.
