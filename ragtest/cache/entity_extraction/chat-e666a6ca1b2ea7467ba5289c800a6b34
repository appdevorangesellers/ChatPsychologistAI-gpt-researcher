The relative importance of a particular risk factor should be considered in terms of prevalence, strength of the association with an adverse outcome, and potential to reduce exposure to that risk factor (Scott and others 2014). Using these criteria, efforts to address maternal mental health problems and improve parenting skills have the greatest potential to reduce mental and developmental disorders in children.Table 8.2Risk Factors for Mental and Developmental Disorders in Children and Adolescents. Consequences of Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersThe consequences of these disorders include the impact during childhood and the persistence of mental ill health into adult life. In childhood, the impact is broad, encompassing the individual suffering of children, as well as the negative effects on their families and peers. This impact may include aggression toward other children and distraction of peers from learning. Children with mental and developmental disorders are at higher risk of mental and physical health problems in adulthood, as well as increased likelihood of unemployment, contact with law enforcement agencies, and need for disability support.Trends in Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersGBD 2010 estimated burden across five time points (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) and found that the prevalence and burden of childhood mental disorders remained consistent between 1990 and 2010 (Erskine and others 2015). Although the rates may not have changed, population growth and aging have impacts on the burden of disease attributable to mental disorders in childhood. As the population of children increases globally, the burden of disease attributable to mental disorders in children will increase.Interventions for Childhood Mental and Developmental DisordersPopulation Platform InterventionsChild and Adolescent Mental Health Policies and PlansFew countries have developed national policies and plans to address mental and developmental disorders in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a modular package for governments, policy makers, and service planners, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Policies and Plans, to address this need (WHO 2005b). The guidelines recommend attention to a broad range of areas pertaining to childhood mental and developmental disorders (box 8.1). The provision of health services for children in isolation will not prevent mental and developmental disorders or have significant benefits for children with these disorders. Instead, an ecological approach that addresses problems in the systems around children (parents, family, and school) in combination with targeted interventions for children is necessary to make a meaningful difference (Kieling and others 2011).Box 8.1Areas for Action for Child and Adolescent Mental Health. Financing Collaboration across sectorsChild Protection LegislationChild maltreatment is a well-established risk factor for mental and developmental disorders in children (Benjet, Borges, and Medina-Mora 2010). Child maltreatment is defined as any form of physical or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, or commercial or other exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to a child’s health, survival, development, or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power (Krug and others 2002). Legislation to address child maltreatment requires the support of well-integrated systems that increase public awareness and enable incident reporting to a constituted authority with investigative and interventional expertise and the ability to prosecute (Svevo-Cianci, Hart, and Rubinson 2010). Limited evidence suggests that legislation to protect children living outside the family home in LMICs has benefits for their health and safety (Fluke and others 2012); however, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such legislation for children living with their families of origin.Community Platform InterventionsEarly Child DevelopmentAttempts have been made to develop community- and primary care–based services in LMICs. Eickmann and others (2003) delivered a community-based psychosocial stimulation intervention to mothers in a study of 156 infants (age 12 months) in four towns in Brazil. The intervention consisted of 14 contacts (three workshops and 11 home visits) where mothers were taught the importance of play for children’s development, how to make toys from disposable household items, and how to play and positively interact with their children. Children of mothers who received the intervention had significantly improved cognitive and motor development; the greatest effects were observed in infants whose development was mildly delayed. The authors proposed the intervention could be delivered through local neighborhood groups run by mothers (Eickmann and others 2003).Powell and others (2004) demonstrate that a psychosocial stimulation intervention could be delivered to infants in Jamaica by community health aid workers in a cluster randomized control trial of 139 mother-infant dyads where the infants were malnourished. The weekly home visits supporting maternal play with children showed that infants in the intervention group had improved overall development as well as improved hearing, speech, and hand-eye coordination. Health aid workers received two weeks of additional training to deliver the intervention, which was provided as part of an existing home visitation program for malnourished children (Powell and others 2004). A follow-up study 25 years later found that those Jamaican children who received early psychosocial stimulation had, on average, 25 percent increased earnings, suggesting long-term economic benefits to infants receiving this intervention (Gertler and others 2014). These studies show psychosocial stimulation is an effective intervention to support cognitive, language, and motor development in young children, conferring short- and long-term benefits, although mental health outcomes were not assessed.The delivery of community-based interventions poses significant challenges, but the feasibility has been demonstrated in LMICs (Bauermeister and others 2006). Brazil, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Israel, and Lebanon implemented and evaluated a comprehensive community-based program with a package of interventions\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
