Thus, emerging evidence from available research suggests parenting skills training is a feasible and effective intervention in LMICs. The extensive research base available from HICs requires integration with knowledge acquired from studies conducted in LMICs for the development of culturally appropriate parenting skills training.Maternal Mental Health InterventionsPoor maternal mental health is a risk factor for children’s physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development (Deave and others 2008; Feldman and others 2009; Glasheen, Richardson, and Fabio 2010; Grace, Evindar, and Stewart 2003; Grigoriadis and others 2013; Grote and others 2010; Hamadani and others 2012; Wachs, Black, and Engle 2009; Wan and others 2007); the impact continues into adolescence and adulthood (Murray and others 2011; Pearson and others 2013). Interventions that target maternal mental health problems, especially in the perinatal period and early infancy, are important for child mental health and need to be incorporated into primary care.Perinatal mental disorders can be divided into common mental disorders (including depression and anxiety disorders) and severe mental disorders (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder). Two meta-analyses have reported that the prevalence of common mental disorders in women in LMICs is between 15.6 percent during pregnancy and 19.8 percent postpartum (Fisher and others 2012; Parsons and others 2012). Maternal depression is the most prevalent condition—and has the largest public health impact (Rahman, Surkan, and others 2013). A recent systematic review identified 16 longitudinal studies of adolescent mental and developmental health outcomes of children of mothers who had postnatal depression. Increased risk of cognitive delays in the children was the most consistent finding, with some studies also reporting that children of mothers with postnatal depression had increased risk of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and increased general psychopathology (Sanger and others 2015). Accordingly, treatment of maternal mental health problems can reduce suffering in the mother while potentially preventing mental and developmental disorders in the children.Postnatal depression is the condition for which interventions are most amenable to integration into primary care and maternal and child health platforms (Rahman, Surkan, and others 2013). Such integration requires task-shifting strategies, supported by the development of training curricula and treatment packages that bundle skills that are logically grouped together for content, training, and operational use (Patel and others 2013).These interventions also require a change in the approach of mental health specialists, as well as health policy and planning specialists—a shift of focus from a model that is specialist and center based to a model that is primary care and community based. Integrated treatment programs, in which health and social care providers are supported to manage common mental health problems, offer a chance to treat the whole person. This approach is more patient centered and is often more effective than one in which mental, physical, and reproductive health problems are addressed separately without effective communication among providers (Patel and others 2013).Maternal and child health workers are well-positioned to adopt comprehensive approaches to care, which is particularly important for children because their psychosocial well-being is closely linked to the mental health of their parents and the quality of their family and school environments. Maternal and child health workers have knowledge of community resources and health, social, and education services, and they can better respond to the specific needs of local communities. In Pakistan, the Canadian “Learning through Play” program was adapted and taught through one-day workshops to women in the Lady Health Workers program, members of the local community who deliver preventive maternal and child health care. A cluster randomized trial demonstrated that an evidence-based program for maternal mental health and child development can be delivered through existing local health workers in an LMIC (Rahman, Surkan, and others 2013).In Chile, a multicomponent intervention for postnatal depression was evaluated in a randomized control trial of 230 women. The intervention consisted of group education about illness and symptoms, problem-solving strategies for mothers, and structured pharmacotherapy when required, delivered through existing local primary care clinics. Compared with those who received treatment as usual, mothers with depression had significant improvements. This study demonstrates the efficacy and feasibility of delivering care to mothers with postnatal depression in an LMIC (Rojas and others 2007).Participatory women’s groups are also a viable model of intervention for postnatal depression. Improvements in maternal and infant health were achieved in a study of 19,030 births in rural India through monthly participatory groups facilitated by peers. The study involved the identification of maternal and neonatal health problems, identification of solutions, and implementation and evaluation of strategies in partnership with local health services (Tripathy and others 2010). This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of participatory women’s groups in reducing postnatal depression in a very poorly resourced region of India.Much of the research on psychological and psychosocial interventions for maternal depression has been conducted in HICs (Sockol, Epperson, and Barber 2011). Substantial evidence indicates that such interventions are effective in reducing depressive symptoms within the first year postpartum (relative risk = 0.70, 95 percent CI: 0.60 to 0.81) (Dennis and Hodnett 2007). Over the past decade, evidence of the effectiveness of interventions led by non-mental health specialists (for example, by nurses, health visitors, or midwives\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>GEO<|>South Africa is a country where a study on parenting skills training was conducted, showing benefits that persisted for 18 months.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ETHIOPIA<|>GEO<|>Ethiopia is a country where a study on parenting skills training was conducted, showing benefits that persisted for six years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LMICs<|>GEO<|>Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) are regions where parenting skills training is deemed feasible and effective.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HICs<|>GEO<|>High-Income Countries (HICs) have an extensive research base that needs to be integrated with knowledge from LMICs for effective parenting skills training.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Interventions aimed at improving maternal mental health, which is crucial for child development.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POSTNATAL DEPRESSION<|>EVENT<|>Postnatal depression is a prevalent condition affecting mothers, with significant public health implications.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAKISTAN<|>GEO<|>Pakistan is a country where the Canadian “Learning through Play” program was adapted for local health workers.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILE<|>GEO<|>Chile is a country where a multicomponent intervention for postnatal depression was evaluated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where participatory women’s groups were implemented to improve maternal and infant health.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH AFRICA<|>LMICs<|>South Africa is an example of an LMIC where parenting skills training studies were conducted<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ETHIOPIA<|>LMICs<|>Ethiopia is another example of an LMIC where parenting skills training studies were conducted<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HICs<|>LMICs<|>HICs have a research base that needs to be integrated with LMICs for effective parenting skills training<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAKISTAN<|>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS<|>In Pakistan, maternal mental health interventions were delivered through local health workers<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHILE<|>POSTNATAL DEPRESSION<|>In Chile, a study evaluated the effectiveness of interventions for postnatal depression<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDIA<|>POSTNATAL DEPRESSION<|>In India, participatory women’s groups were implemented to address postnatal depression<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
