It encompasses strategies to amplify, maintain, or decrease one’s emotional responses. It involves a range of strategies, from cognitive reappraisal to mindfulness practices, that help individuals cope with difficult situations and have emotional control. Effective emotion regulation has been linked to a range of positive outcomes, including improved well-being, better interpersonal relationships, and enhanced resilience in the face of stress and adversity. Being able to regulate emotions is a skill, meaning that people often learn emotional regulation as they grow up. Some people may find it easier than others to regulate their emotions. Emotional regulation reflects a set of processes that influence: Which emotions someone has When they have these emotions How they experience and express these emotions Emotional regulation is not to be confused with eliminating or controlling emotions but with moderating the experience of the emotions being experienced. This includes the ability to alter the intensity or duration of an emotion rather than changing it completely. Being able to moderate the intensity of the emotion can help to control behavior and emotional reactions. When an emotion is felt, for example, anger, this can be triggered when feeling threatened or powerless. Why is emotional regulation important? Being able to regulate emotions is important since our emotions are closely connected to how we think and feel. Our thoughts and feelings help us to decide how best to respond to a situation and what action we should take. Essentially, emotional regulation can influence behavior. Learning skills to regulate our emotions means that, instead of acting impulsively and doing something that may be regretted later, we are able to make thought-out choices. This can mean that we can learn to manage relationships with others, problem-solve, and have better control over our mental health. If our emotions are shut down or avoided, we may struggle with powerlessness, negative thinking, ruminating, resentment, and increased frustration. This could result in the development of anxiety, depression, or physical complaints. Examples of common emotion regulation strategies Below are some of the common healthy and unhealthy emotion regulation strategies that people use: Healthy strategies These can include the following: Practicing meditation or mindfulness Engaging in therapy Talking through emotions with friends Develop emotional intelligence skills Writing in a journal Noticing when a break is needed – having some space from others Having good sleep hygiene Unhealthy strategies These can include the following: Self-injurious behaviors Alcohol and substance abuse Emotional eating Avoiding or withdrawing from difficult situations Excessive use of social media to the exclusion of other responsibilities Withdrawing from others – social isolation What is emotion dysregulation? Emotion dysregulation is the inability to use healthy strategies to diffuse or moderate negative emotions. It is common for people to occasionally use less-than-ideal emotional regulation strategies. However, individuals who regularly experience overwhelming, intense, negative emotions are much more likely to rely on unhealthy strategies.
