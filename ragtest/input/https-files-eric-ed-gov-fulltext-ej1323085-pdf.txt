purpose of this study is to examine the debt burdens, perceived capabilities, and mental health of young
adults. Panel data constructed from the 2009 to 2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and
its Transition to Adulthood (TA) supplement are used in this study. The multinomial logistic regression analysis
findings showed that the amount of revolving debt was negatively associated with young adults’ mental health.
On the other hand, perceived abilities in acting responsibly, in solving problems, and in managing money were
positively associated with the mental health of young adults. The fixed effects regression analysis results indicate
that the amounts of credit card and student loan debt from the previous period were negatively associated with
an increase in the mental health continuum scores of young adults over time. A discussion of the implications of
this study’s key findings for scholars, policymakers, and practitioners is included.

S
tudent loan and credit card debt burdens among
young adults in the United States have increased in
the past two decades. With the rise in education costs
and stagnant government grants, the student loan burden has
increased substantially (Cilluffo, 2017; Davidson, 2017).
More than 35 million Americans are currently paying stu-
dent loan debt (Williams, 2014). The rapid growth of debt
among young people has drawn the attention of researchers,
educators, and policymakers. Student loan debt has a nega-
tive effect on household savings and increases households’
probability of delinquency of debts and bankruptcy, thus
affecting their financial well-being over time (Elliot & Nam,
2013; Rothstein & Rouse, 2011). Student loan debt has also
been associated with a delay in decisions to marry or have
a child (Gicheva, 2016; Velez et al., 2019). Furthermore,
higher debt for young people has been associated with worse
health outcomes (Dugan & Kafka, 2014; Kim & Chatterjee,
2019).

addition to student loan debt, high unsecured debt, such
as credit card debt, is also found to affect the well-being of
households negatively. People use unsecured debt to pur-
chase goods and services and take on unsecured debt at
higher interest to supplement the unexpected shortfall in
their regular income (Dwyer, 2018; Houle & Berger, 2017).
Hodson et al. (2014) found that transitioning young adults
perceive unsecured debt as an investment, and they perceive
their ability to accrue debt as empowering, and although
unsecured debt has a positive association with the percep-
tion of well-being for young adults in the short run if an
unpaid, unsecured debt can have an adverse effect on peo-
ples’ mental health over the long term. Consistent with this,
Sun and Houle’s (2018) study found that higher levels of
unsecured debt were associated with negative mental health
outcomes over time.

higher debt was associated with worse mental and
physical health (Sweet et al., 2013). Some argue that the
more student loans people have, the worse their mental
health outcomes will be (Williams, 2014). Unsecured debt
can adversely affect self-esteem and general self-efficacy
(Dwyer et al., 2011), lower young adults’ perceived well-
being (Zhang & Kemp, 2009), and lead to less frequent
volunteerism (Stevenson, 2008) and academic behavior
(Hogan et al., 2013). Financial strain from debts is associ-
ated with anxiety, depression, and lower physical health in

association between financial capability and positive
mental health of young people has rarely been studied.
Past studies have generally focused on negative outcomes
such as anxiety and depression rather than positive emo-
tional states or well-being (Keyes, 2002). Seligman (2002)
suggested that examining behavior that positively affects
young adults’ well-being is necessary for developing poli-
cies to improve the mental health of college students. The
purpose of the current study is to examine whether debt-
and financial-capability-related characteristics are associ-
ated with the flourishing or languishing of young adults,
based on Keyes’s mental health continuum, and to explore
the relationship between student loan and credit card debt
and the mental health of young adults.

strain resulting from financial problems such as
reduced income and increased debt has been previously
associated with perceived psychological stress and poorer
mental health (Kahn & Pearlin, 2006). Debt has been specif-
ically linked to subjects’ psychological functioning (Brown
et al., 2005), depressive symptoms (Hojman et al., 2016),
and mental disorders (Jenkins et al., 2008). Credit card debt
has been linked to financial stress and negative health out-
comes (Adams & Moore, 2007; Nelson et al., 2008).

has been a steady increase in the number of college stu-
dents reporting psychological problems (Cooke et al., 2004;
Eisenberg et al., 2009; Fink, 2014; Roberts et al., 1999).
During periods of economic uncertainty, the potential health
risks of carrying a financial burden from the cost of a col-
lege education may be larger if there is unstable employment
to maintain stable income than otherwise anticipated (Law,
2014).

difficulty resulting from col-
lege students’ financial debt (Cooke et al., 2004; Richard-
son et al., 2017) was associated with mental health problems
of undergraduate students. Concerns related to finances
increased for undergraduate students as they progressed
through college (Cooke et al., 2004). Furthermore, Robb
(2017) found that financially stressed students were also
more likely to report lower subjective financial well-being.
High levels of financial debts were associated with poor
social functioning (Hoeve et al., 2014).

few studies have examined the association
between subjective well-being and student loan debt of
young adults (Tay et al., 2017). However, understanding
the relationship between student loan debt and well-being,
including its impact on positive emotions, and whether stu-
dent loan debt also affects young adults’ ability to thrive
across multiple domains of life can help broaden the debate
on student loan debt (Nissen et al., 2019). Tay et al. (2017)
found that the association between student loan debt and
financial satisfaction was mediated by financial worry.
Heckman et al. (2014) identified debt and financial insuffi-
ciency to be two significant financial stressors for college
students. Other studies have found that student loan debt was
negatively associated with life satisfaction, psychological
well-being, and financial wellness of individuals (Aboagye
& Jung, 2018; Kim & Chatterjee, 2019). Letkiewicz et al.
(2014) found that students who had higher amounts of stu-
dent loan debt (more than $50,000) were more likely to
take longer than 4 years to graduate from college. Addition-
ally, Johnson et al. (2016) found that students had very little
knowledge regarding student loans. Lee et al. (2019) found
that student loan debt increased the risk of debt delinquency
among households.

other areas of psychology, which study psycholog-
ical deficiencies in individuals, the field of positive psy-
chology emphasizes factors that improve the well-being of
individuals. Keyes (2002) suggested a continuum of men-
tal health, including flourishing, moderate mental health,
and languishing. Keyes and Waterman (2003) suggested
that an individual’s perceived or subjective well-being is a
self-assessment of their mental health and their psycholog-
ical and social functioning. This categorization presents a
broader paradigm of mental health beyond the more con-
ventionally accepted states of mental disorder or absence of
mental disorder (Keyes, 2002, 2006).

show that those flourishing are more adaptive
to challenges than non-flourishers (Bergsma et al., 2011;
Diener & Seligman, 2004; Huppert, 2009; Kobau et al.,

2011). Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
Child Development Supplement (CDS), Keyes (2002)
found that 40% of young respondents were flourishing, 6%
were languishing, and the rest were moderately mentally
healthy. Flourishing describes the level at which life expe-
riences have gone well for individuals (Diener et al., 2010;
Henderson et al., 2014; Keyes, 2002; Seligman, 2011).
Flourishing encompasses the emotional, psychological, and
social well-being of individuals (Keyes, 2002). Flourishing
individuals engage in adaptive coping strategies and exhibit
innovative and flexible behavior, while depressed or lan-
guishing individuals engage in more maladaptive coping
strategies (Faulk et al., 2013; Fredrickson & Losada, 2005).
Based

on the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions,
Faulk et al. (2013) suggested that positive emotions could
expand the coping strategies and decision-making abilities
of young adults. Fredrickson and Losada (2005) suggested
that individuals, who experienced at least 2.9 positive emo-
tions for every negative emotion (3:1 for practical purposes),
were more likely to flourish (Faulk et al., 2013). How-
ever, limited information is available about the impact of
debt burden on positive psychology or positive mental well-
being of young adults.
Factors of Languishing and Flourishing

on Keyes’ (2002, 2003) mental health continuum,
an individual’s mental health may be associated with other
social, psychological, or cognitive-functioning-related fac-
tors (Garmezy, 1993; Luthar, 1991; Werner, 2000). Finan-
cial situation variables such as debt burden, income, and
wealth have been associated with the mental health of young
adults (Cooke et al., 2004; Sweet et al., 2013; Tay et al.,
2017; Walsemann et al., 2015). Studies by Cooke et al.
(2004) and Sweet et al. (2013) found debt burden to be
negatively associated with mental health outcomes, stud-
ies by Tay et al. (2017) and Walsemann et al. (2015) found
that family resources, problem-solving abilities, and income
moderated the association between debt and subjective well-
being of individuals.

variables such as education, age, gen-
der, and race have been associated with children’s mental
health and resiliency (Keyes, 2002; Schotanus-Dijkstra et
al., 2016). Educational attainment was positively associated
with flourishing mentally and had higher perceived well-
being (Keyes, 2002; Schotanus-Dijkstra et al., 2016). Also,
young adults were more likely to flourish mentally when
compared with older adults (Keyes, 2002). Women were
found to have more extreme emotional responses to both
positive and negative situations (Schotanus-Dijkstra et al.,
2016). Whites were positively associated with flourishing
mentally, and conversely, were negatively associated with
languishing (Keyes, 2002).

has also been found that attributes such as having a sta-
ble family background and receiving affection and warmth
from parents and caregivers are positively associated with
a flourishing mental state (Garmezy, 1993). Closeness to
parents is another factor that reduces the risk of children’s
negative behavior (Werner, 2000). Additionally, parents’
educational attainment (Luthar, 1991) and family financial
situation have also been associated with the financial well-
being of young adults (Kim & Chatterjee, 2013).

adults’ level of social engagement could also influ-
ence their mental health. Low (2011) found that civic
and community engagement was positively correlated with
flourishing among first-year college students. Positively
perceived experiences from community engagement or
service-learning have been linked to reduced mental health
issues such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety
(Ottenritter, 2004). These positive experiences are included
in the psychological and social dimensions of the Keyes
continuum (Keyes, 2007; Low, 2011).

study uses data from the PSID and its Transition to
Adulthood (TA) supplement to examine the associations
among debt burdens, perceived financial capability, and
the physical and psychological well-being of young adults.
The PSID is a longitudinal study of a nationally represen-
tative sample of U.S. men, women, and children, as well
as their families. For approximately the past four decades,
the study has collected annual data from these families and
individuals with regard to their demographic, economic,

and employment behavior. The TA supplement includes
data on young adults aged 17–29. For the empirical anal-
ysis of this study, data on parental influence, student loan
debt, social participation, psychological and cognitive well-
being, development, and perceived ability were drawn from
the TA supplement. Respondents under 18 years of age were
excluded from the analysis. This study uses a panel con-
structed from the 2009 to 2013 waves of the PSID and its
TA supplement.
Variables
Dependent Variables. The
I

dependent variables for this
study were constructed based on a composite mental health
continuum scale that measured the emotional, social, and
psychological well-being of the respondents, which is
included in the PSID-TA dataset. The scale was originally
included in the Midlife in the United States study (MIDUS)
and has since been available in the PSID-TA supplement for
the 2009–2013 waves. The scale itself comprises three dif-
ferent sub-scales: the MIDUS scale of emotional well-being
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87) (Kessler et al., 1998); Ryff’s scale
of psychological well-being (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.79) (Ryff
& Keyes, 1995); and Keyes’s scale of social well-being
(Cronbach’s alpha = .80) (Keyes, 1998). The emotional
well-being sub-component developed originally by Kessler
et al. (1998) comprised of three items related to emotional
well-being—happiness, interest in life, and feeling satisfied.
All three items were coded as 1 = lowest and 6 = high-
est. The psychological well-being sub-component was orig-
inally developed by Ryff and Keyes (1995) and included
the following six items—feeling good about managing daily
responsibility, perception of having trusting relationships,
feeling challenged to grow, feeling confident of own ideas,
liking one’s own personality, and feeling of having direction
in life. All six items were coded as 1 = lowest and 6 = high-
est. The social well-being sub-component was developed by
Keyes (1998) and comprised of the following five items:
feeling of having something to contribute to in society, feel-
ing of belonging to the community, feeling of society get-
ting better, feeling that people are generally good, feeling
the way that society works makes sense. All six items were
coded as 1 = lowest and 6 = highest. The scores from these
sub-components were then scaled to the participants’ scores
on the composite flourishing-languishing continuum scale
and ranged from 1 = least flourishing to 18 = most flourish-
ing. This composite scale is computed and made available in
the PSID-TA dataset. Respondents with higher scores on the
composite scale (range: 1–18) are considered to be flourish-
ing mentally, while respondents with lower scores are con-
sidered to be languishing mentally. The Cronbach’s alpha
for the scale in our study was .77.
Keyes

(2002) sorted the respondents into three groups based
on their scores on the Keyes mental health continuum scale.
From this scale, Keyes constructed separate binary variables
for flourishing and languishing based on the respondents’
scores on the scale. The respondents in the top tertile of
scores in the scale were coded as flourishing, those in the
bottom tertile of the scale were coded as languishing, and
those who were in the middle tertile were coded as moder-
ate. Similarly, we follow this methodology in our study to
construct a categorical variable where 3 = flourishing (score
in the top tertile of the Keyes scale); 2 = moderate or sta-
ble (score in the middle tertile of the Keyes scale); 1 = lan-
guishing (score in the bottom tertile of the Keyes scale). We
also use the composite scale in the secondary analysis of this
study to examine changes in the scale over time.

factors. These variables are described below:
Financial Situation and Perceived Ability.

finan-
cial situation variables included continuous variables for
income, family wealth, student loan debt, and credit card
debt. Log values of these variables were included in the
empirical models estimated in this study. The perceived
abilities variables were perceived responsibility (7-point
Likert-type scale: 1 = not at all well; 7 = extremely well),
problem-solving ability (1 = not at all well; 7 = extremely
well); ability to pay off credit card debt (1 = not at all well;
7 = extremely well); and the ability to manage money (1 =
not at all well; 7 = extremely well).

comprise four binary variables: graduated from college (1 =
yes; 0 = otherwise); currently in college (1 = yes; 0 = oth-
erwise); dropped out of college (1 = yes; 0 = otherwise);
and never attended college (1 = yes; 0 = otherwise). In the
empirical models used in this study, the currently in col-
lege variable has been used as the reference group, and the
other educational attainment variables have been compared
against this variable. Age is included as a continuous vari-
able, and gender is coded as female (1 = yes; 0 = male). Four
binary variables for race/ethnicity included in this study are
non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, and other races. In the
empirical analyses, the non-Hispanic White category was
used as the reference group.

the parental influence-related variables, mother and
father’s number of years of education were included in
the model. The PSID-TA dataset also includes information
on the emotional closeness of respondents to their parents.
Closeness to father (1 = least close; 7 = very close) and
closeness to mother (1 = least close; 7 = very close) were
also included as control variables in this category.
Social Engagement.

volunteering activities, social activism; school clubs; art,
music, or theater performances; and sports. These variables
were coded as binary (1 = yes; 0 = otherwise).

descriptive statistics of the dataset, along with a table of
correlation of mental flourishing with financial situation and
perceived abilities-related factors, are presented in Tables 1
and 2. In this study, the first dependent variableYit is cate-
gorical (1 = languishing; 2 = moderate (base); 3 = flourish-

data comprised a panel constructed from three consecutive
waves (2009, 2011, and 2013) of the PSID and its TA sup-

the dependent variables, with only time-varying factors as
control variables in a fixed effects model. Panel data esti-

results of the descriptive statistics are shown in Table
1. The descriptive statistics indicate that 32% of the respon-
dents reported having student loans, and 20% reported
having credit card debt. The average amount of student
outstanding loans for the respondents was $19,889, and
the average amount of credit card debt among the respon-
dents was $2,021. Regarding educational attainment, 11%
of the respondents had graduated from college, 43% were
in college, 17% had dropped out of college, and 29% never
attended college. Demographically, 44% of the respondents
were White and 52% were female. Approximately 25% of
the respondents reported participating in some volunteering
activities and 19% participated in sports.

had a significant negative correlation with mental health
score (𝜌= −10.5%). All of the perceived abilities-related
variables had a significant and positive correlation with
mental health scores. The correlation table and a correlation

health (b = 0.333; p < .001) were positively associated with
flourishing mentally. Among the sociodemographic factors,
the likelihood of flourishing mentally decreased with drop-
ping out of college (b = −0.561; p < .001). Age (b = 0.036;
p < .01) was positively associated with flourishing mentally.
Among the factors related to parental influence, closeness
to the mother (b = 0.098; p < .001) was significant and pos-
itively associated with flourishing mentally.
Compared

to the baseline of respondents with moderate
mental health scores, the determinants of respondents who
languished are shown in Columns 4–6 of Table 2. The results
indicate that income (b = −0.022; p < .05) was negatively
associated, and the amount of credit card debt (b = 0.032; p
< .05) was positively associated with the likelihood of lan-
guishing mentally. Perceived problem-solving (b = −0.125;
p < .01) and money management (b = −0.282; p < .001) abil-
ities reduced the likelihood of languishing among respon-
dents. Graduating from college (b = −0.488; p < .01) was
also negatively associated with the likelihood of languishing
mentally. Among parental influence-related factors, close-
ness to the mother (b = −0.168; p < .001), closeness to
the father (b = −0.084; p < .01), and the father’s education
(b = −0.004; p < .01) were negatively associated with lan-
guishing for the respondents. Participation in social activi-
ties (b = −0.094; p < .001) was negatively associated with
languishing mentally.
Factors Associated With the Dynamics of Positive

The

results shown in Table 3 indicate the association
between time-varying factors and change in mental health
continuum score across the period of this study (2009–
2013). The results show that flourishing mentally (b = 0.776;
p < .001) in the previous period was positively associated
with change in mental health score. Among the financial
situation-related factors, income (b = 0.002; p < .05) and
family wealth (b = 0.126; p < .01) in the current period were
positively associated with an increase in mental health (bet-
ter mental health) score. Conversely, the amount of student
loans (b = −0.003; p < .001) and credit card debt (b = −0.007;
p < .01) in the previous period were negatively associated
with an increase in mental health score. Among the per-
ceived abilities and health-related factors, the perceptions of
being responsible (b = 0.128; p < .001), being a problem-
solver (b = 0.013; p < .05), being good at managing money
(b = 0.014; p < .01), and being in excellent health (b = 0.129;
p < .001) were positively associated with an increase in men-
tal health score over time.

study examined the factors associated with the mental
health state of young adults, with a specific focus on finan-
cial well-being and their perceived financial capabilities.
The results from the fixed effects analysis with time-varying

factors indicate that the amounts of student loans and credit
card debt in the previous period were associated with nega-
tive changes in mental health continuum scores across time.
Additionally, the amount of credit card debt was negatively
associated with flourishing and positively associated with
languishing in the cross-sectional analyses. These findings
are consistent with those of Heckman et al. (2014) study,
which found debt to be positively associated with financial
stress among college students. In another study, Lim et al.
(2014) found that, among other factors, student loan debt
was a predictor of stress among students.
Interestingly,
I
D
:
p

income was negatively associated with being
languishing, not flourishing, while family wealth was posi-
tively associated only with flourishing. Both family wealth
and income might affect young adults’ mental health signif-
icantly but in different ways. Being financially responsible
and having excellent health are positively associated with
being flourishing but not languishing. These findings sug-
gest that focusing only on negative mental health outcomes
may underestimate the effect of family wealth, being finan-
cially responsible, and health on the positive end of the men-
tal health continuum, or flourishing.
Similarly,
I
D

previous studies have found using cross-sectional
data that financial debt was associated with poorer health
(Fitch et al., 2011; Hoeve et al., 2014). However, debt has
not been studied previously in relation to the flourishing-
languishing mental health continuum across time. In our
study, credit card debt was associated with a decreased like-
lihood of flourishing and increased likelihood of languish-
ing. These findings suggest that credit card debt burden
could decrease positive mental health, while young adults
may not exhibit the languishing or mental health disorder
from credit card debt. Additionally, student loan debt in
the previous period was also associated with a decrease in
flourishing over the current period. This negative associa-
tion between student loan debt and flourishing is consistent
with findings from previous studies that found student loan
debt was negatively associated with life satisfaction across
time (Kim & Chatterjee, 2019) and was detrimental to young
adults’ mental health (Walsemann et al., 2015). Similarly,
in another study, Archuleta et al. (2013) found that student
loan debt was associated with financial anxiety and distress.
However, the overall negative effects of a financial bur-
den on young adults’ well-being might not have been fully
explored. The negative effects on flourishing may decrease
optimal human functioning (Seligman et al., 2005), which
is a key asset for well-being and long-term social and eco-
nomic prosperity (Barry, 2009). These findings add to the
literature by showing that both student loan debt and credit
card debt negatively affect the mental health of young adults
across time.

study found that those using adaptive coping strate-
gies were more likely to be flourishing. On the other hand,
individuals who are languishing may benefit from par-
ticipation in social activities (Low, 2011) and improving
perceived financial management capabilities. Perceived
abilities such as being financially responsible, solving prob-
lems, and managing money increased the likelihood of
flourishing mentally significantly, while perceived ability in
problem-solving and money management were negatively
associated with languishing. These results are consistent
with previous studies that found problem-solving abilities
and financial self-efficacy to be positively associated with
the psychological well-being of young adults (Garmezy et
al., 1984; Heckman et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2014; Robb,
2017). The present study also extends these findings to
show that, in addition to problem-solving abilities, task-
specific perceptions of individuals’ abilities such as the abil-
ity to manage money and the perception of being financially
responsible were associated with the psychological well-
being of young adults.

Britt et al. (2016) found that financial knowl-
edge was significantly associated with greater awareness
of options, resulting in reduced anxiety while borrowing.
Poor financial capability and debt have been linked to men-
tal health problems such as depression and anxiety among
young adults (Adams & Moore, 2007). Furthermore, this
finding related to the positive association between perceived
abilities and flourishing/languishing in our study suggests
that interventions to improve people’s perceived abilities in
managing money might contribute positively to their emo-
tional, psychological, and social functioning.

negative association between closeness to parents and
languishing and the positive association between closeness
to parents and flourishing were consistent with the find-
ings from previous studies that found a positive associa-
tion between receiving better family and social support and
the physical and mental health of young adults (Schotanus-
Dijkstra et al., 2016). Consistent with previous research

(Low, 2011), engagement in social activities was associated
with both flourishing and languishing states of young adults.
These findings were consistent with those from previous
studies, which found that participation and engagement in
social and community events had a positive association with
mental health and a negative association with depression
or mental languishing (Keyes, 2007; Low, 2011; Ottenrit-
ter, 2004). Providing opportunities to participate in various
social activities might be important to the mental health of
young adults.
Limitations and Future Directions

the limitations of the dataset and the young age of
the respondents, detailed information on the effect of finan-
cial asset holdings on the mental health continuum was not
included in the analyses. However, future studies are needed
to examine the role of financial asset holdings of the respon-
dents in the model. Although this study used panel data and
examined respondents across time, more studies are needed
to establish causality between flourishing and the covariates
that were found to be significantly associated with flourish-
ing in this study. The mental health and functioning of young
adults is an issue of universal interest. Future studies exam-
ining the predictors of flourishing among young adults in
other countries should be encouraged. It will be important
to examine the enduring factors that remain associated with
flourishing as these young adults grow older and reach the
asset accumulation phase of their life cycle.

findings from the current study show that perceived
financial capability is positively associated with mentally
flourishing and negatively associated with mentally lan-
guishing. Additional research is needed to see the long-term
effects of financial capability on mental health. This rela-
tionship could also be bi-directional; that is, mental health
states could influence perceived confidence in peoples’
financial capability and financial well-being, as languishing
has been found to be negatively associated with productiv-
ity and psychosocial functioning in a previous study (Keyes,
2007).

light of the growing concerns about the financial debts of
young people, the findings suggest that the ability to man-
age consumer debt such as credit cards and student loans
is important and that a better ability to manage debt may
be beneficial for the mental health and well-being of young
adults. Financial and mental health counselors need to be
aware of this relationship and make appropriate referrals for
young adults as needed. Financial educators and counselors,
when counseling young adults with debt burdens, may need
to help their clients realize the negative financial conse-
quences of debts such as delinquency, bankruptcies, and
decreased net worth for their mental health and well-being.
Furthermore, they can coach young people in improving
their financial management skills and abilities to understand
the lifelong impacts of borrowing and make informed deci-
sions in borrowing. More targeted education and counseling
may be needed for those young people who exhibit signs of
overborrowing or potential debt problems. Financial educa-
tion programs have been found to improve financial man-
agement skills and confidence (Fernandes et al., 2014). Such
financial education and counseling can be used as an inter-
vention, especially for moderately mentally healthy people.
Understanding and promoting the well-being and mental
flourishing of young adults may be as important as address-
ing mental illness.

finding that participation in social activities was neg-
atively associated with languishing underscores the impor-
tance of promoting greater opportunities for group-oriented
activities across neighborhoods, as this can improve both
social capital and sense of well-being among young
adults. Schools should also emphasize similar activities
that encourage student participation. A related recent study
found experiential learning to be an effective method of
financial socialization of children (LeBaron et al., 2019).
Financial education programs based on experiential learn-
ing, such as peer financial education or providing educa-
tion and mentoring opportunities in the community, could
benefit young adults. By engaging in their own behaviors
and others’, young adults may increase their participation in
social activities as well as improve their own financial capa-
bility, both of which will lead to improved mental health. It
is suggested that policies should address the financial and
mental health of young adults, such as the inclusion of health
and financial clinics on college campuses. Young adults who
are not currently in college need opportunities to improve
social engagement and financial capabilities at a low or min-
imal cost.

findings from this study indicate that while endow-
ment factors such as family wealth, closeness to mother,
and health are positively associated with a flourishing

state of mind in young adults, perception of one’s abil-
ity or self-efficacy-related factors, such as the percep-
tion of being financially responsible, confidence in one’s
problem-solving, and money management abilities are also
positively associated with flourishing. And additionally,
dropping out of college and higher levels of credit card debt
are negatively associated with flourishing. These associa-
tions between flourishing and perceived ability, debt bur-
den, and educational attainment also have policy implica-
tions. Keyes (2002) suggests that flourishing is positively
associated with better psychosocial functioning, overall
health, and well-being of individuals. Asebedo et al. (2020)
found that implementing positive psychology-based inter-
ventions can be effective in improving peoples’ financial
self-efficacy, their overall financial well-being. LeBaron et
al. (2019) found that experiential learning was an impor-
tant tool for financial socialization. Financial socialization-
related practices by parents, such as opening a bank account
for their children and regularly monitoring their children’s
spending, were positively associated with better financial
practices among young adults as they grew older (Kim &
Chatterjee, 2013). Perhaps, creating greater access to finan-
cial education opportunities that integrate experiential learn-
ing into the curriculum could be beneficial in building con-
fidence in young adults’ perception of their abilities to man-
age money and debt. Creating campus-based programs that
encourage college and high school students to complete
their studies, provide financial education opportunities, and
educate them to practice positive financial management can
be useful strategies that may be useful in improving the
flourishing state of mind among young adults.
