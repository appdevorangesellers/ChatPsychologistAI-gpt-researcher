Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Mental Health Psychology What Is the DSM-5 and What Does It Diagnose? By Aubrey Bailey, PT, DPT, CHT Updated on September 02, 2024 Medically reviewed by Steven Gans, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents History Major Changes Who Uses It List of Disorders How It Is Used Close The DSM-5, otherwise known as the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," Fifth Edition, is a book published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to help mental health providers diagnose mental disorders. The DSM-5 is an invaluable tool given that mental disorders cannot be diagnosed in the same way as physical illnesses. The DSM-5 categorizes 298 mental disorders based on an established set of criteria, such as behavioral or emotional patterns and the duration of these patterns. This helps psychiatrists, psychologists, and other health providers accurately diagnose mental illness so that the appropriate treatment can be sought and dispensed. In 2022, a revised version called the DSM-5-TR was published. The DSM is occasionally updated as researchers gain a better understanding of mental conditions, often re-characterizing them to more accurately reflect their nature. PeopleImages / Getty Images History of the DSM-1 Through DSM-5 Differs The "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" was first published in 1952 and has been revised and published in four subsequent editions and several interim versions. The latest version, the DSM-5-TR, was published in March 2022. DSM-1 The 130-page DSM-1 published in 1952 listed 109 mental disorders under three broad classifications: psychotic, neurotic, or behavioral. As with future editions, the DSM-1 was criticized for characterizing certain states as pathologies (illnesses). This included homosexuality which the DSM-1 classified as a "sociopathic personality disturbance." DSM-2 The DSM-2 published in 1968 was only slightly longer than the DSM-1 (134 pages) but contained a total of 182 mental disorders. As with the DSM-1, the symptoms of these disorders were not always clearly defined. Rather, symptoms were often regarded as a reflection of an underlying conflict or maladaptive reaction to life problems (largely remnants of Freudian psychoanalysis of the 1920s and 1930s). As such, the DSM-2 largely characterized mental illness as a consequence of external factors rather than a disorder of the mind. DSM-3 The 494-page DSM-3 published in 1980 was regarded as a radical revision of the earlier editions, adopting a consistent set of diagnostic criteria to classify 265 mental disorders. Among the changes in the DSM-3, "ego-dystonic homosexuality" replaced the term "sexual orientation disturbance," while gender identity disorder in children (GIDC) was first introduced to describe the concept of gender dysphoria. DSM-4 The DSM-4 published in 1994 listed 410 disorders in 886 pages. In it, a mental disorder was for the first time defined as "a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that... is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom." The definition was significant in that it qualified a mental disorder as one that causes distress and/or problems functioning in social, work, or family life—a definition that largely persists today. Despite these changes, homosexuality was still described as a "sexual disorder not otherwise specified," while "mental retardation" was still used to describe people with intellectual disabilities. DSM-5 The DSM-5 published in 2013 was not a major revision of the DSM-4. Rather, it focused largely on deleting numerous subtypes that caused overlaps in diagnoses and sowed confusion among clinicians. From the 410 conditions listed in the DSM-4, the DSM-5 offered 298. Among the changes: The five subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual) were deleted, housing schizophrenia under its own category. Subtypes of autism (including Asperger's syndrome, classic autism, and Rett syndrome) were also deleted and replaced with the diagnosis autism spectrum disorder (ASD) Rather than classifying subtypes, the DSM-5 more often uses specifiers to clarify the course, severity, or special features of a disorder. For instance, specifiers for a condition like autism may be as simple as "mild," "moderate," or "severe." Others may be more complex. Among the other changes in the DSM-5, homosexuality was finally declassified as a mental illness, gender dysphoria replaced gender identity disorder, intellectual disability replaced mental retardation, and manic-depression was reclassified as bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 disorder. Major Differences Between the DSM-4 and DSM-5 One of the main differences between the DSM-4 and DSM-5 is the discontinuation of the multiaxial model. This is a system in which five factors—psychiatric, intellectual, medical, environmental/psychological, and level of functioning—are considered to characterize and standardize diagnoses. While these factors are still considered in DSM-5 guidelines, the multiaxial model lacked clarity and could potentially mischaracterize a condition based on how these factors were interpreted. Other changes include: The addition of six new classes of mental disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders and elimination disorders The discontinuation of four classes of mental disorders, including factitious disorders and adjustment disorders The reclassification of mental disorders, such as breaking down sexual and gender identity disorders into sexual dysfunctions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders What Is the DSM-5 Used For? The DSM-5 serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses in the United States. While it is published by a U.S. health authority, it is used worldwide and published in 18 different languages. The DSM-5 contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria to help clinicians make reliable diagnoses of mental disorders. However, it does not include information or guidelines for the treatment of any disorder. Instead, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other health providers will turn to clinical practice guidelines from the APA, which does offer guidance on the appropriate treatment. Other countries use different clinical practice guidelines, which can vary based on the licensing of drugs, availability of drugs, or authorized treatments (such as ketamine therapy). In the United States, the diagnoses in the DSM-5 match up with ICD-10 codes used by clinicians for insurance approval and payment. Based on the ICD-10 code of a DSM-5 diagnosis, a treatment may be approved or denied. The DSM-5 is written in a common language and divided into three sections: Section 1 describes how to use the manual.Section 2 lists the signs and symptoms—the diagnostic criteria—for specific mental disorders.Section 3 explains how to address culture, gender, and other factors to make more informed assessments and diagnoses. List of Mental Disorders in the DSM-5 The DSM-5 breaks down mental disorders into 19 broad categories. It is possible—and, in fact, common—for a person to be diagnosed with multiple disorders in one or more categories (known as a "dual diagnosis" or "multiple diagnosis"). While the DSM-5 focuses on mental disorders, conditions involving the mind and brain are often inseparable. For this reason, the DSM-5 also covers conditions like dementia that may be purely psychiatric, purely neurological, or both. The DSM-5-TR categories include: Mood and Stress-Related Disorders Bipolar and related disorders, including bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 disorder Depressive disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), and specific phobias Trauma- and stressor-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reactive attachment disorder (RAD) Cognitive Disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder Personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder (BPD) and paranoid personality disorder (PPD) Dissociative disorders, including dissociative amnesia and dissociative identity disorder (DID, formerly known as a "split personality") Neurocognitive disorders, including dementia and amnestic disorder Somatic symptoms and related disorders, including somatic symptom disorder (SSD Compulsive Disorders Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders, including antisocial personality disorder (APD) Substance-related and addictive disorders, including substance use disorder (SUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and gambling disorder (formerly "gambling addiction") Functional Disorders Feeding and eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and anorexia nervosa Elimination disorders, involving the inappropriate elimination of urine or feces Sleep-wake disorders, including narcolepsy and insomnia disorder Gender Identity and Sexual Disorder Sexual dysfunctions, including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) Gender dysphoria, including separate criteria for children, adolescents, and adults Paraphilic disorders, involving recurring or intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, locations, events, fantasies, or individuals How the DSM-5 Is Used For each condition, the DSM-5 outlines a list of criteria a person must meet in order to be diagnosed with that disorder. Some criteria are behavioral (like repetitive behaviors) while others may be emotional (like distress). There will also be a specific period during which a person must experience symptoms in order to be diagnosed. The DSM-5 also offers a category called "unspecified disorder" which allows a clinician to forgo specification. This is used when a patient's symptoms fall within a group of disorders but do not meet the DSM-5 criteria exactly. "Unspecified disorder" has an ICD-10 code, meaning that insurance approval and coverage for treatment can still be sought. The DSM-5 Checklist The DSM-5 checklist is a list of diagnostic criteria for each classified mental disorder. It can be used to screen for a specific disorder (such as PTSD or substance abuse disorder), characterize the severity of the condition, and monitor for changes in symptoms. The checklist is structured as a questionnaire and administered by a trained clinician during a one-on-one interview. During the interview, the patient is asked to rate symptoms or experiences with responses like "not at all," "a little bit," moderately," "quite a bit," and "extremely." Each of these responses is assigned a numerical score. The scores are then added up and interpreted by the clinician. Summary The "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," Fifth Edition, is the premier source of diagnostic information on mental health conditions. The 298 disorders are broken down into 19 categories with each assigned a list of criteria a person must meet to be diagnosed. The DSM-5 does not offer treatment guidance but provides clinicians with the means to access treatments based on approved national treatment guidelines and the ICD-10 code assigned to that DSM-5 diagnosis. 7 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Close The DSM-5, otherwise known as the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," Fifth Edition, is a book published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to help mental health providers diagnose mental disorders. The DSM-5 is an invaluable tool given that mental disorders cannot be diagnosed in the same way as physical illnesses. The DSM-5 categorizes 298 mental disorders based on an established set of criteria, such as behavioral or emotional patterns and the duration of these patterns. This helps psychiatrists, psychologists, and other health providers accurately diagnose mental illness so that the appropriate treatment can be sought and dispensed. In 2022, a revised version called the DSM-5-TR was published. The DSM is occasionally updated as researchers gain a better understanding of mental conditions, often re-characterizing them to more accurately reflect their nature. PeopleImages / Getty Images History of the DSM-1 Through DSM-5 Differs The "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" was first published in 1952 and has been revised and published in four subsequent editions and several interim versions. The latest version, the DSM-5-TR, was published in March 2022. DSM-1 The 130-page DSM-1 published in 1952 listed 109 mental disorders under three broad classifications: psychotic, neurotic, or behavioral. As with future editions, the DSM-1 was criticized for characterizing certain states as pathologies (illnesses). This included homosexuality which the DSM-1 classified as a "sociopathic personality disturbance." DSM-2 The DSM-2 published in 1968 was only slightly longer than the DSM-1 (134 pages) but contained a total of 182 mental disorders. As with the DSM-1, the symptoms of these disorders were not always clearly defined. Rather, symptoms were often regarded as a reflection of an underlying conflict or maladaptive reaction to life problems (largely remnants of Freudian psychoanalysis of the 1920s and 1930s). As such, the DSM-2 largely characterized mental illness as a consequence of external factors rather than a disorder of the mind. DSM-3 The 494-page DSM-3 published in 1980 was regarded as a radical revision of the earlier editions, adopting a consistent set of diagnostic criteria to classify 265 mental disorders. Among the changes in the DSM-3, "ego-dystonic homosexuality" replaced the term "sexual orientation disturbance," while gender identity disorder in children (GIDC) was first introduced to describe the concept of gender dysphoria. DSM-4 The DSM-4 published in 1994 listed 410 disorders in 886 pages. In it, a mental disorder was for the first time defined as "a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that... is associated with present distress or disability or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom." The definition was significant in that it qualified a mental disorder as one that causes distress and/or problems functioning in social, work, or family life—a definition that largely persists today. Despite these changes, homosexuality was still described as a "sexual disorder not otherwise specified," while "mental retardation" was still used to describe people with intellectual disabilities. DSM-5 The DSM-5 published in 2013 was not a major revision of the DSM-4. Rather, it focused largely on deleting numerous subtypes that caused overlaps in diagnoses and sowed confusion among clinicians. From the 410 conditions listed in the DSM-4, the DSM-5 offered 298. Among the changes: The five subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual) were deleted, housing schizophrenia under its own category. Subtypes of autism (including Asperger's syndrome, classic autism, and Rett syndrome) were also deleted and replaced with the diagnosis autism spectrum disorder (ASD) Rather than classifying subtypes, the DSM-5 more often uses specifiers to clarify the course, severity, or special features of a disorder. For instance, specifiers for a condition like autism may be as simple as "mild," "moderate," or "severe." Others may be more complex. Among the other changes in the DSM-5, homosexuality was finally declassified as a mental illness, gender dysphoria replaced gender identity disorder, intellectual disability replaced mental retardation, and manic-depression was reclassified as bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 disorder. Major Differences Between the DSM-4 and DSM-5 One of the main differences between the DSM-4 and DSM-5 is the discontinuation of the multiaxial model. This is a system in which five factors—psychiatric, intellectual, medical, environmental/psychological, and level of functioning—are considered to characterize and standardize diagnoses. While these factors are still considered in DSM-5 guidelines, the multiaxial model lacked clarity and could potentially mischaracterize a condition based on how these factors were interpreted. Other changes include: The addition of six new classes of mental disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders and elimination disorders The discontinuation of four classes of mental disorders, including factitious disorders and adjustment disorders The reclassification of mental disorders, such as breaking down sexual and gender identity disorders into sexual dysfunctions, gender dysphoria, and paraphilic disorders What Is the DSM-5 Used For? The DSM-5 serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses in the United States. While it is published by a U.S. health authority, it is used worldwide and published in 18 different languages. The DSM-5 contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria to help clinicians make reliable diagnoses of mental disorders. However, it does not include information or guidelines for the treatment of any disorder. Instead, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other health providers will turn to clinical practice guidelines from the APA, which does offer guidance on the appropriate treatment. Other countries use different clinical practice guidelines, which can vary based on the licensing of drugs, availability of drugs, or authorized treatments (such as ketamine therapy). In the United States, the diagnoses in the DSM-5 match up with ICD-10 codes used by clinicians for insurance approval and payment. Based on the ICD-10 code of a DSM-5 diagnosis, a treatment may be approved or denied. The DSM-5 is written in a common language and divided into three sections: Section 1 describes how to use the manual.Section 2 lists the signs and symptoms—the diagnostic criteria—for specific mental disorders.Section 3 explains how to address culture, gender, and other factors to make more informed assessments and diagnoses. List of Mental Disorders in the DSM-5 The DSM-5 breaks down mental disorders into 19 broad categories. It is possible—and, in fact, common—for a person to be diagnosed with multiple disorders in one or more categories (known as a "dual diagnosis" or "multiple diagnosis"). While the DSM-5 focuses on mental disorders, conditions involving the mind and brain are often inseparable. For this reason, the DSM-5 also covers conditions like dementia that may be purely psychiatric, purely neurological, or both. The DSM-5-TR categories include: Mood and Stress-Related Disorders Bipolar and related disorders, including bipolar 1 and bipolar 2 disorder Depressive disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), panic disorder (PD), and specific phobias Trauma- and stressor-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reactive attachment disorder (RAD) Cognitive Disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder Personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder (BPD) and paranoid personality disorder (PPD) Dissociative disorders, including dissociative amnesia and dissociative identity disorder (DID, formerly known as a "split personality") Neurocognitive disorders, including dementia and amnestic disorder Somatic symptoms and related disorders, including somatic symptom disorder (SSD Compulsive Disorders Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders, including antisocial personality disorder (APD) Substance-related and addictive disorders, including substance use disorder (SUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and gambling disorder (formerly "gambling addiction") Functional Disorders Feeding and eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and anorexia nervosa Elimination disorders, involving the inappropriate elimination of urine or feces Sleep-wake disorders, including narcolepsy and insomnia disorder Gender Identity and Sexual Disorder Sexual dysfunctions, including female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) Gender dysphoria, including separate criteria for children, adolescents, and adults Paraphilic disorders, involving recurring or intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, locations, events, fantasies, or individuals How the DSM-5 Is Used For each condition, the DSM-5 outlines a list of criteria a person must meet in order to be diagnosed with that disorder. Some criteria are behavioral (like repetitive behaviors) while others may be emotional (like distress). There will also be a specific period during which a person must experience symptoms in order to be diagnosed. The DSM-5 also offers a category called "unspecified disorder" which allows a clinician to forgo specification. This is used when a patient's symptoms fall within a group of disorders but do not meet the DSM-5 criteria exactly. "Unspecified disorder" has an ICD-10 code, meaning that insurance approval and coverage for treatment can still be sought. The DSM-5 Checklist The DSM-5 checklist is a list of diagnostic criteria for each classified mental disorder. It can be used to screen for a specific disorder (such as PTSD or substance abuse disorder), characterize the severity of the condition, and monitor for changes in symptoms. The checklist is structured as a questionnaire and administered by a trained clinician during a one-on-one interview. During the interview, the patient is asked to rate symptoms or experiences with responses like "not at all," "a little bit," moderately," "quite a bit," and "extremely." Each of these responses is assigned a numerical score. The scores are then added up and interpreted by the clinician. Summary The "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders," Fifth Edition, is the premier source of diagnostic information on mental health conditions. The 298 disorders are broken down into 19 categories with each assigned a list of criteria a person must meet to be diagnosed. The DSM-5 does not offer treatment guidance but provides clinicians with the means to access treatments based on approved national treatment guidelines and the ICD-10 code assigned to that DSM-5 diagnosis. 7 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
