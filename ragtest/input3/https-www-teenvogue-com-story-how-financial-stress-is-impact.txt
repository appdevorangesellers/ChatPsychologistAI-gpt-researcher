But while all of that has undoubtedly shaped young people‚Äôs idea of the world, so has their financial future.According to the Deloitte Millennial Survey, many young people feel high levels of stress, and money is near the top of their worry list. The survey found that 41% of millennials and 46% of Gen Z respondents were stressed all or most of the time, and about two-thirds of each group listed their financial future as a significant source of that worry. While financial stress is nothing new, a growing generational wealth gap complicates the picture ‚Äî for instance, the cost of buying a house today is much steeper than it was when our grandparents were buying homes, even when adjusted for inflation and rising salaries. According to some experts, the financial stress young people are feeling might impact their mental health.‚ÄúFinancial uncertainty can be a source of great stress for anyone, but especially so for young folks,‚Äù Israa Nasir, a mental health counselor in New York City, told Teen Vogue. ‚ÄúFinancial anxiety and stress is especially stressful to the millennial/Gen Z generation at the moment because of the world we are living in right now. While years ago, it was possible for young people to be able to purchase homes and live comfortably two to three years out of college, that is no longer a possibility given the economic climate and financial markets. Uncertainty brought up by the pandemic, student debt, and rising housing prices can add a layer of stress to an already stressful juncture of life.‚ÄùThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded money stress for everyone, as most of the country was thrown into disarray, causing huge levels of unemployment and disruptions across industries that we have yet to fully recover from. For young people, this has been magnified. As of July 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 22.5 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 are in the labor force. Among the most popular jobs for these young people are retail trade and leisure and hospitality work ‚Äî in other words, public-facing jobs we often consider essential workers. Their financial success can be linked to systemic failures. For example, when states fail to uphold a mask or vaccine mandate, it can hurt the young service workers who must work grueling shifts to serve customers who don't always respect these protocols, potentially at the expense of their well-being.And, as Nasir mentioned, the world looks very different financially than it did 50 years ago.Well-paying job options for people without college degrees are few and far between, a shift from when boomers could enter the job market fresh out of high school. But research has shown that unemployment rates for millennials are much higher if they forgo a college degree ‚Äî making it essentially a necessity. For many, the cost of attending college is a burden, but the financial impact of schooling extends beyond the price of admission.‚ÄúAs a college student, you‚Äôre constantly invited to things that cost money like going to bars, restaurants, museums, random events that require you to pay for something,‚Äù says Ria, a senior at DePaul University. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really stressful, especially for me, and it‚Äôs something that I don‚Äôt notice a lot of people talking about. I‚Äôve been raised on the belief that I have to save everything I earn, but then you enter the college sphere and almost everybody is spending money on everything ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt want to miss out by staying home.‚ÄùIf you're unable to keep up with expected milestones, Nasir said it can have an impact mentally.‚ÄúFrom a psycho-social development point of view, this stage of life is driven by building connection/intimacy and feelings of ‚Äòusefulness and accomplishments.‚Äô Finances are a big part of enabling that," she said. "In this stage of life, young people face societal pressures to establish the foundation of their careers, to find life-partners, to ‚Äòmove on to the next stage‚Äô so to speak. So, financial stress causes a lot of anxiety about next steps in life and what that can look like.‚ÄùDespite the evidence that many money problems stem from institutional flaws, there‚Äôs still the stigma that financial instability is always a personal problem ‚Äî contributing to money's mental health impact.‚ÄúMoney is so tied up into shame in many different ways. And the pandemic has certainly only exacerbated this, particularly for people who faced or are still facing long stretches of unemployment,‚Äù says Erin Lowry, founder of Broke Millennial, to Teen Vogue. ‚ÄúOn one hand, I hope it‚Äôs made it a little bit easier to have some of these conversations because if you were let go from your job because your entire industry shuttered, that is completely outside of your control. There is literally nothing that you have to take blame for in that scenario. But shame and debt are so intertwined and I think a lot of that ultimately comes down to our inability to talk about it."Most PopularShopping12 Best Beauty Tools to Nail an At-Home Solo Spa DayBy Kara NesvigShoppingThe Sephora Black Friday Sale Is a Perfume Collector's DreamBy Donya MomenianShoppingMadewell's Black Friday Deals Include Trusty Wardrobe StaplesBy Donya MomenianGiven this country‚Äôs student loan debt ($1.57 trillion total) and medical debt ($140 billion total), there are more than enough reason why young people are finding themselves in financial trouble. Yet, consumer debt is often seen as a sign of irresponsibility. This is further compounded by myths like saving money on lattes can buy a house or young people enjoying avocado toast is why they don‚Äôt have savings. Even though some Americans would rather Uber to the emergency room than pay exorbitant ambulance bills (or avoid seeing doctors altogether), the idea that all young people are bad at money management is a fabricated one that evades infrastructural responsibility altogether.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve put a big morality spin on debt in this country in a way that is completely ridiculous. We need to separate morality and money,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúMoney is a tool in our lives that we use. There's just so many different reasons that people end up in debt. And to play the morality game about debt is bad and evil and it is not helpful for anybody's mental health.‚ÄùThe myth of the hardworking American who can pull themselves up by the bootstraps isn't even close to reality for most, but young people are still facing the ramifications of a society that punishes them for not having money ‚Äî even though many of the financial milestones that were accessible for older generations are now further out of reach out of reach for millennials and Gen Z.‚ÄúI grew up with a scarcity mentality; I can't remember a time in my life when the world felt stable, or like my future isn't in jeopardy because of some world tragedy,‚Äù says Hannah, a freshman at the University of Kansas. ‚ÄúI'm at the age where we're supposed to start planning for our future, but everything is so chaotic right now that there's not a ‚Äòright‚Äô choice‚Äîat least not one afforded to most of this generation.

Young people in the United States are growing up in increasingly chaotic times: In addition to the traditional uncertainty that comes with adolescence, Gen Z‚Äôs coming-of-age is also riddled with issues such as climate change , Zoom schooling, and a volatile political landscape. But while all of that has undoubtedly shaped young people‚Äôs idea of the world, so has their financial future.According to the Deloitte Millennial Survey, many young people feel high levels of stress, and money is near the top of their worry list. The survey found that 41% of millennials and 46% of Gen Z respondents were stressed all or most of the time, and about two-thirds of each group listed their financial future as a significant source of that worry. While financial stress is nothing new, a growing generational wealth gap complicates the picture ‚Äî for instance, the cost of buying a house today is much steeper than it was when our grandparents were buying homes, even when adjusted for inflation and rising salaries. According to some experts, the financial stress young people are feeling might impact their mental health.‚ÄúFinancial uncertainty can be a source of great stress for anyone, but especially so for young folks,‚Äù Israa Nasir, a mental health counselor in New York City, told Teen Vogue. ‚ÄúFinancial anxiety and stress is especially stressful to the millennial/Gen Z generation at the moment because of the world we are living in right now. While years ago, it was possible for young people to be able to purchase homes and live comfortably two to three years out of college, that is no longer a possibility given the economic climate and financial markets. Uncertainty brought up by the pandemic, student debt, and rising housing prices can add a layer of stress to an already stressful juncture of life.‚ÄùThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded money stress for everyone, as most of the country was thrown into disarray, causing huge levels of unemployment and disruptions across industries that we have yet to fully recover from. For young people, this has been magnified. As of July 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 22.5 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 are in the labor force. Among the most popular jobs for these young people are retail trade and leisure and hospitality work ‚Äî in other words, public-facing jobs we often consider essential workers. Their financial success can be linked to systemic failures. For example, when states fail to uphold a mask or vaccine mandate, it can hurt the young service workers who must work grueling shifts to serve customers who don't always respect these protocols, potentially at the expense of their well-being.And, as Nasir mentioned, the world looks very different financially than it did 50 years ago.Well-paying job options for people without college degrees are few and far between, a shift from when boomers could enter the job market fresh out of high school. But research has shown that unemployment rates for millennials are much higher if they forgo a college degree ‚Äî making it essentially a necessity. For many, the cost of attending college is a burden, but the financial impact of schooling extends beyond the price of admission.‚ÄúAs a college student, you‚Äôre constantly invited to things that cost money like going to bars, restaurants, museums, random events that require you to pay for something,‚Äù says Ria, a senior at DePaul University. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really stressful, especially for me, and it‚Äôs something that I don‚Äôt notice a lot of people talking about. I‚Äôve been raised on the belief that I have to save everything I earn, but then you enter the college sphere and almost everybody is spending money on everything ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt want to miss out by staying home.‚ÄùIf you're unable to keep up with expected milestones, Nasir said it can have an impact mentally.‚ÄúFrom a psycho-social development point of view, this stage of life is driven by building connection/intimacy and feelings of ‚Äòusefulness and accomplishments.‚Äô Finances are a big part of enabling that," she said. "In this stage of life, young people face societal pressures to establish the foundation of their careers, to find life-partners, to ‚Äòmove on to the next stage‚Äô so to speak. So, financial stress causes a lot of anxiety about next steps in life and what that can look like.‚ÄùDespite the evidence that many money problems stem from institutional flaws, there‚Äôs still the stigma that financial instability is always a personal problem ‚Äî contributing to money's mental health impact.‚ÄúMoney is so tied up into shame in many different ways. And the pandemic has certainly only exacerbated this, particularly for people who faced or are still facing long stretches of unemployment,‚Äù says Erin Lowry, founder of Broke Millennial, to Teen Vogue. ‚ÄúOn one hand, I hope it‚Äôs made it a little bit easier to have some of these conversations because if you were let go from your job because your entire industry shuttered, that is completely outside of your control. There is literally nothing that you have to take blame for in that scenario. But shame and debt are so intertwined and I think a lot of that ultimately comes down to our inability to talk about it."Most PopularShopping12 Best Beauty Tools to Nail an At-Home Solo Spa DayBy Kara NesvigShoppingThe Sephora Black Friday Sale Is a Perfume Collector's DreamBy Donya MomenianShoppingMadewell's Black Friday Deals Include Trusty Wardrobe StaplesBy Donya MomenianGiven this country‚Äôs student loan debt ($1.57 trillion total) and medical debt ($140 billion total), there are more than enough reason why young people are finding themselves in financial trouble. Yet, consumer debt is often seen as a sign of irresponsibility. This is further compounded by myths like saving money on lattes can buy a house or young people enjoying avocado toast is why they don‚Äôt have savings. Even though some Americans would rather Uber to the emergency room than pay exorbitant ambulance bills (or avoid seeing doctors altogether), the idea that all young people are bad at money management is a fabricated one that evades infrastructural responsibility altogether.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve put a big morality spin on debt in this country in a way that is completely ridiculous. We need to separate morality and money,‚Äù Lowry said. ‚ÄúMoney is a tool in our lives that we use. There's just so many different reasons that people end up in debt. And to play the morality game about debt is bad and evil and it is not helpful for anybody's mental health.‚ÄùThe myth of the hardworking American who can pull themselves up by the bootstraps isn't even close to reality for most, but young people are still facing the ramifications of a society that punishes them for not having money ‚Äî even though many of the financial milestones that were accessible for older generations are now further out of reach out of reach for millennials and Gen Z.‚ÄúI grew up with a scarcity mentality; I can't remember a time in my life when the world felt stable, or like my future isn't in jeopardy because of some world tragedy,‚Äù says Hannah, a freshman at the University of Kansas. ‚ÄúI'm at the age where we're supposed to start planning for our future, but everything is so chaotic right now that there's not a ‚Äòright‚Äô choice‚Äîat least not one afforded to most of this generation.

Uncertainty brought up by the pandemic, student debt, and rising housing prices can add a layer of stress to an already stressful juncture of life.‚ÄùThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded money stress for everyone, as most of the country was thrown into disarray, causing huge levels of unemployment and disruptions across industries that we have yet to fully recover from. For young people, this has been magnified. As of July 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 22.5 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 are in the labor force. Among the most popular jobs for these young people are retail trade and leisure and hospitality work ‚Äî in other words, public-facing jobs we often consider essential workers. Their financial success can be linked to systemic failures. For example, when states fail to uphold a mask or vaccine mandate, it can hurt the young service workers who must work grueling shifts to serve customers who don't always respect these protocols, potentially at the expense of their well-being.
Young people in the United States are growing up in increasingly chaotic times: In addition to the traditional uncertainty that comes with adolescence, Gen Z‚Äôs coming-of-age is also riddled with issues such as climate change , Zoom schooling, and a volatile political landscape. But while all of that has undoubtedly shaped young people‚Äôs idea of the world, so has their financial future.According to the Deloitte Millennial Survey, many young people feel high levels of stress, and money is near the top of their worry list. The survey found that 41% of millennials and 46% of Gen Z respondents were stressed all or most of the time, and about two-thirds of each group listed their financial future as a significant source of that worry. While financial stress is nothing new, a growing generational wealth gap complicates the picture ‚Äî for instance, the cost of buying a house today is much steeper than it was when our grandparents were buying homes, even when adjusted for inflation and rising salaries.

And, as Nasir mentioned, the world looks very different financially than it did 50 years ago.Well-paying job options for people without college degrees are few and far between, a shift from when boomers could enter the job market fresh out of high school. But research has shown that unemployment rates for millennials are much higher if they forgo a college degree ‚Äî making it essentially a necessity. For many, the cost of attending college is a burden, but the financial impact of schooling extends beyond the price of admission.‚ÄúAs a college student, you‚Äôre constantly invited to things that cost money like going to bars, restaurants, museums, random events that require you to pay for something,‚Äù says Ria, a senior at DePaul University. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really stressful, especially for me, and it‚Äôs something that I don‚Äôt notice a lot of people talking about. I‚Äôve been raised on the belief that I have to save everything I earn, but then you enter the college sphere and almost everybody is spending money on everything ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt want to miss out by staying home.‚ÄùIf you're unable to keep up with expected milestones, Nasir said it can have an impact mentally.‚ÄúFrom a psycho-social development point of view, this stage of life is driven by building connection/intimacy and feelings of ‚Äòusefulness and accomplishments.‚Äô Finances are a big part of enabling that," she said. "In this stage of life, young people face societal pressures to establish the foundation of their careers, to find life-partners, to ‚Äòmove on to the next stage‚Äô so to speak. So, financial stress causes a lot of anxiety about next steps in life and what that can look like.‚ÄùDespite the evidence that many money problems stem from institutional flaws, there‚Äôs still the stigma that financial instability is always a personal problem ‚Äî contributing to money's mental health impact.‚ÄúMoney is so tied up into shame in many different ways. And the pandemic has certainly only exacerbated this, particularly for people who faced or are still facing long stretches of unemployment,‚Äù says Erin Lowry, founder of Broke Millennial, to Teen Vogue. ‚ÄúOn one hand, I hope it‚Äôs made it a little bit easier to have some of these conversations because if you were let go from your job because your entire industry shuttered, that is completely outside of your control.

Given this country‚Äôs student loan debt ($1.57 trillion total) and medical debt ($140 billion total), there are more than enough reason why young people are finding themselves in financial trouble.
