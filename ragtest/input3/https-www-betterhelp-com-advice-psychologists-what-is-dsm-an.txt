DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is a book used by healthcare providers to diagnose and treat clients with mental illnesses using common language, just as medical physicians have common terminology for clarity in diagnosing diseases. Learning more about how the DSM works and why it is used can offer insight into how professionals may support you in a psychotherapy or psychiatry session.GettyTherapists use the DSM to help patientsLearn more about how in online therapyWhat is DSM in psychology? The American Psychiatric Association definitionThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a tool mental health professionals use to diagnose and classify mental illnesses. The current definition of a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is "a mental health condition involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." The most recent edition of the DSM covers nearly 300 mental conditions including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, prolonged grief disorder, neurodevelopmental disorders, and disorders caused by adverse effects of medication.If you are experiencing trauma, support is available. Please see our Get Help Now page for more resources.The DSM’s development process included more than 200 researchers and clinicians, and although it has some controversy surrounding it, this tool has been used by psychologists, psychotherapists, counselors, social workers, doctors, and psychiatrists since its publishing date in 1952 by the American Psychiatric Association. In DSM history, the APA has revised it five times; the current version is the DSM-5. Since its inception, the goal of the DSM has been to accommodate the need for psychiatric canon and a standardized way of categorizing disorders that present symptoms in the population. With the field of psychology continually progressing, it is often revised to accommodate newly discovered mental illnesses, phasing out labels that no longer fit or changing terminology. Mental health professionals use the DSM to rule out, determine, and examine a client's symptoms and narrow them down to an appropriate diagnosis. It is also helpful in explaining symptoms and diagnostic criteria to clients and knowing how to direct treatment.Though the DSM helps professionals classify mental illness, it does not offer treatment options for curious readers. Professionals use the tool only as a reference. In addition, insurance companies may require diagnostic codes for billing purposes. The DSM also provides a basis for research and treatment to further the study of psychology. This tool allows clinicians and researchers to develop new ways to combat symptoms and treat disorders.How is the DSM organized?The American Psychiatric Association separates the DSM into three sections: Diagnostic classificationDiagnostic criteria sets DescriptionsDiagnostic classification The first section of the DSM involves a complete list of all psychiatric disorders. In addition, it lists codes for health professionals to use for diagnostic and billing purposes. This section may differ from the rules in the ICD, the International Classification of Diseases.There are numerous categories in the DSM-V, including Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders, Bipolar and Related Disorders, Personality Disorders, and Depressive Disorders. Within these categories are several sub-categories. For example, under the category Neurodevelopmental Disorders are the sub-categories Intellectual Disorders, Communication Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Classifications of certain disorders have changed over the years, and new categories have been created to reflect developments in experts’ understanding of these mental health conditions. For example, bipolar disorders were listed under the category of Mood Disorders in the DSM-IV. In the DSM-V, however, a new category was created specifically for the subtypes of bipolar disorder—Bipolar and Other Disorders—further differentiating them from conditions like major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. The names of certain disorders have also changed in the DSM over time. For example, the term autism spectrum disorder is used in the DSM-V to encompass four previously distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. This change echoes the stated views of many experts that the conditions—autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified—are actually different manifestations of the same disorder. The DSM-V also allows physicians to add a severity specifier to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Diagnostic criteria sets The second section of the DSM focuses on the methods of identifying mental illness. In this section, the clinician references how the client's presenting symptoms match the existing criteria outlined in the manual regarding behaviors, feelings, and the time the symptoms present for a diagnosis to occur. They may use the requirements to make a diagnosis of mental disorders. Some clients may have symptoms from more than one diagnosis. Descriptions The third section of the manual includes emerging measures and models, which go into a further description of each disorder and its subsets. It also includes information about how cultural influences or cultural differences could affect a diagnosis. The report might be used to learn more about a condition and develop a treatment plan, although the DSM does not suggest any treatments. GettyWho can use the DSM? Trained professionals only use the DSM as a diagnostic tool in treating psychological disorders. While it is available to the public, professionals do not recommend its usage if you're not a professional. Someone may best make a psychiatric diagnosis with the experience and schooling to offer a correct diagnosis. While the DSM is used as a reference by individuals across the globe, its diagnostic criteria are primarily followed by physicians in the United States. Why has the DSM been revised so often?Due to the constant change of cultural norms and ever-evolving research, the DSM has gone through regular text revision to account for these changes and stay relevant. For example, the causes of a mental health condition may be better understood with research, and the DSM may change to reflect that cause. Since its inception, psychology has continued to evolve. Researchers and psychologists understand that certain mental health conditions may need updating or eliminating due to the change in understanding. As the techniques for treatment have expanded over the years, so must the criteria and classification of disorders. Examples of DSM updates may include more concise and accurate descriptions, appropriately outlining revised criteria, creating unbiased reports of the cause of the mental illness, updating risk and prognostic factors, and revising the descriptive language.What is the DSM controversy? Because the APA has revised the DSM many times over the years, some professionals exercise caution when using it because the limited outlines of mental illnesses may prevent the proper diagnosis of patients. Sometimes symptoms for conditions will overlap. For example, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder can have similar symptoms. In addition, symptoms may mask themselves as other conditions, or clients may not be upfront about all their symptoms. Diagnosis may not always be the most accurate tool for treatment. Many psychologists also work from a "treat the symptoms, not the condition" point of view. This can be problematic in the case of an axis II personality disorder, for instance, some symptoms of which can be difficult to differentiate from non-clinical personality traits or signs of other mental health conditions.Outdated information and information based on social and cultural biases can also be harmful. Homosexuality and gender provide an example of how, if it weren't for evolving research, clients would still receive "treatment" for these identities, which are not mental or psychological illnesses. In the early years of the DSM, homosexuality was listed as a disorder without empirical evidence to determine it as such until it was removed in 1973. Another recent example is gender dysphoria, which was referred to as “gender identity disorder” from 1980 when it was added until 2013 when it was updated.Some critics believe the DSM promotes the use of psychotropic medications as treatment for many mental illnesses for the financial gain of pharmaceutical companies. Many critics presume that the descriptions and requirements for diagnosis are deliberately broad for pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of potential patients. A few of the authors of the DSM in the past have been involved financially with these institutions, so this issue has been considered a conflict of interest in history. Despite these controversies, the DSM remains a trusted tool for researchers and clinicians looking for updated ways to diagnose and treat illnesses. The breadth and scope of research and contributions from mental health professionals worldwide make it a resource that can offer practical guidance. However, many psychotherapists also use the ICD manual for psychological diagnosis, which may be the primary guide in other countries. How do psychologists make a diagnosis? Diagnosing a mental illness can be a multi-step process. The professional psychologist or psychiatrist you meet with may evaluate your physical health, current medical condition, and any history of diseases from you or your family. For further study, they may present you with a questionnaire and ask you questions about your symptoms, background, and any thoughts you may have about your symptoms. They can then use the information gathered from this process and the DSM-5 to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan. GettyTherapists use the DSM to help patientsLearn more about how in online therapyCounseling options for mental healthIf you believe you are experiencing symptoms of a mental illness, you may find it valuable to reach out to a licensed psychotherapist. Symptoms can present themselves differently from person to person and can change with time. In addition, you don't need a diagnosis to see a provider. Many psychotherapists can work with you based on your symptoms and goals for treatment. You can meet with a psychotherapist online if you face barriers to seeing a provider in person, such as distance, cost, or other concerns. Although many online therapists cannot make diagnoses, they can guide you in building a treatment plan and understanding yourself more profoundly. Platforms like BetterHelp connect clients with licensed, accredited psychotherapists experienced in mental health challenges. You can choose the right psychotherapist for you, and they'll work with you to develop a treatment plan on your schedule via online messaging, video chat, or phone call sessions. If you're unsure about the effectiveness of internet-based counseling, studies show that it can be as effective as in-person options. One study that reviewed 17 studies on online psychotherapy found that it was effective in reducing symptoms of common mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. One of the 17 studies showed that online treatment could be more effective than in-person options for treating depression.TakeawayThe DSM is a popular tool for diagnosing mental health conditions and providing diagnostic categories and criteria for clinicians, therapists, and insurance companies. The DSM classifies many prevalent mental health conditions. Personality disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder,dissociative disorders, and hundreds more. It also clarifies common terminology, such as autism spectrum and gender dysphoria, to create clarity across the many branches of psychology. However, the DSM is not the only diagnostic tool available, and many therapists treat symptoms individually. If you're interested in learning more about receiving a diagnosis or learning about mental health symptoms, consider reaching out to a provider in your area or online to get started.Read moreFrequently asked questions (FAQs)Below are some of the most commonly asked questions about the DSM in psychology. What is the DSM-5 definition of mental disorders?A mental disorder is a mental or psychological illness. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) website defines mental illness as "health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." What is the difference between the DSM-4 and DSM-5?The revisions made to the DSM-5 were made to improve the classification of psychological and mental health conditions. The DSM-5 includes terminology and diagnoses not present in the DSM-4, allowing more people to get an accurate diagnosis. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are no longer listed under anxiety disorders, and gender dysphoria is now considered a psychological diagnosis. The frequently asked questions page on the APA website explains the need for the changes made in the DSM-5 by saying, "Many of the changes in DSM–5 were made to characterize better symptoms and behaviors of groups of people who are currently seeking clinical help, but whose symptoms are not well defined by DSM–IV (meaning they are less likely to have to treatment). By more accurately defining disorders, we hope that diagnosis and clinical care will be improved, and new research will be facilitated to further our understanding of mental disorders."What are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual psychological categories?The categories included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) include the following: Neurodevelopmental disordersSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disordersBipolar and related disordersDepressive disordersAnxiety disordersObsessive-compulsive and related disordersTrauma and stressor-related disordersDissociative disordersSomatic symptoms and associated disordersFeeding and eating disordersElimination disordersSleep-wake disordersSexual dysfunctionsDisruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disordersSubstance-related and addictive disordersNeurocognitive disordersPersonality disordersParaphilic disordersOther mental disordersWhat does the DSM-5 stand for?"DSM-5" is the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

When diagnosing mental illness, psychologists use the DSM-5. When using everyday language, however, some people still reference diagnoses and terms used in the DSM-4. For example, people may refer to ADD, which is no longer a diagnosis in the DSM-5. Instead, ADHD has been split into three psychological categories. What is a DSM psychological category?Categories in the DSM are used to group psychological and mental health conditions. For example, eating disorders are listed under the DSM category "feeding and eating disorders," and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is under the category called "trauma and stressor-related disorders." Therapists, psychiatrists, general doctors, and those in the field of social work may reference the DSM. Clients, families, and clients seeking general or basic mental health information do not necessarily need to know all the details of the DSM categories.

The DSM also provides a basis for research and treatment to further the study of psychology. This tool allows clinicians and researchers to develop new ways to combat symptoms and treat disorders.How is the DSM organized?The American Psychiatric Association separates the DSM into three sections: Diagnostic classificationDiagnostic criteria sets DescriptionsDiagnostic classification The first section of the DSM involves a complete list of all psychiatric disorders. In addition, it lists codes for health professionals to use for diagnostic and billing purposes. This section may differ from the rules in the ICD, the International Classification of Diseases.There are numerous categories in the DSM-V, including Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders, Bipolar and Related Disorders, Personality Disorders, and Depressive Disorders. Within these categories are several sub-categories. For example, under the category Neurodevelopmental Disorders are the sub-categories Intellectual Disorders, Communication Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Classifications of certain disorders have changed over the years, and new categories have been created to reflect developments in experts’ understanding of these mental health conditions. For example, bipolar disorders were listed under the category of Mood Disorders in the DSM-IV. In the DSM-V, however, a new category was created specifically for the subtypes of bipolar disorder—Bipolar and Other Disorders—further differentiating them from conditions like major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. The names of certain disorders have also changed in the DSM over time. For example, the term autism spectrum disorder is used in the DSM-V to encompass four previously distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. This change echoes the stated views of many experts that the conditions—autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified—are actually different manifestations of the same disorder. The DSM-V also allows physicians to add a severity specifier to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Diagnostic criteria sets The second section of the DSM focuses on the methods of identifying mental illness. In this section, the clinician references how the client's presenting symptoms match the existing criteria outlined in the manual regarding behaviors, feelings, and the time the symptoms present for a diagnosis to occur. They may use the requirements to make a diagnosis of mental disorders. Some clients may have symptoms from more than one diagnosis. Descriptions The third section of the manual includes emerging measures and models, which go into a further description of each disorder and its subsets. It also includes information about how cultural influences or cultural differences could affect a diagnosis. The report might be used to learn more about a condition and develop a treatment plan, although the DSM does not suggest any treatments. GettyWho can use the DSM? Trained professionals only use the DSM as a diagnostic tool in treating psychological disorders. While it is available to the public, professionals do not recommend its usage if you're not a professional. Someone may best make a psychiatric diagnosis with the experience and schooling to offer a correct diagnosis. While the DSM is used as a reference by individuals across the globe, its diagnostic criteria are primarily followed by physicians in the United States. Why has the DSM been revised so often?Due to the constant change of cultural norms and ever-evolving research, the DSM has gone through regular text revision to account for these changes and stay relevant. For example, the causes of a mental health condition may be better understood with research, and the DSM may change to reflect that cause. Since its inception, psychology has continued to evolve. Researchers and psychologists understand that certain mental health conditions may need updating or eliminating due to the change in understanding. As the techniques for treatment have expanded over the years, so must the criteria and classification of disorders. Examples of DSM updates may include more concise and accurate descriptions, appropriately outlining revised criteria, creating unbiased reports of the cause of the mental illness, updating risk and prognostic factors, and revising the descriptive language.What is the DSM controversy? Because the APA has revised the DSM many times over the years, some professionals exercise caution when using it because the limited outlines of mental illnesses may prevent the proper diagnosis of patients. Sometimes symptoms for conditions will overlap. For example, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder can have similar symptoms. In addition, symptoms may mask themselves as other conditions, or clients may not be upfront about all their symptoms. Diagnosis may not always be the most accurate tool for treatment. Many psychologists also work from a "treat the symptoms, not the condition" point of view. This can be problematic in the case of an axis II personality disorder, for instance, some symptoms of which can be difficult to differentiate from non-clinical personality traits or signs of other mental health conditions.Outdated information and information based on social and cultural biases can also be harmful. Homosexuality and gender provide an example of how, if it weren't for evolving research, clients would still receive "treatment" for these identities, which are not mental or psychological illnesses. In the early years of the DSM, homosexuality was listed as a disorder without empirical evidence to determine it as such until it was removed in 1973. Another recent example is gender dysphoria, which was referred to as “gender identity disorder” from 1980 when it was added until 2013 when it was updated.Some critics believe the DSM promotes the use of psychotropic medications as treatment for many mental illnesses for the financial gain of pharmaceutical companies. Many critics presume that the descriptions and requirements for diagnosis are deliberately broad for pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of potential patients. A few of the authors of the DSM in the past have been involved financially with these institutions, so this issue has been considered a conflict of interest in history. Despite these controversies, the DSM remains a trusted tool for researchers and clinicians looking for updated ways to diagnose and treat illnesses. The breadth and scope of research and contributions from mental health professionals worldwide make it a resource that can offer practical guidance. However, many psychotherapists also use the ICD manual for psychological diagnosis, which may be the primary guide in other countries. How do psychologists make a diagnosis? Diagnosing a mental illness can be a multi-step process. The professional psychologist or psychiatrist you meet with may evaluate your physical health, current medical condition, and any history of diseases from you or your family. For further study, they may present you with a questionnaire and ask you questions about your symptoms, background, and any thoughts you may have about your symptoms. They can then use the information gathered from this process and the DSM-5 to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan. GettyTherapists use the DSM to help patientsLearn more about how in online therapyCounseling options for mental healthIf you believe you are experiencing symptoms of a mental illness, you may find it valuable to reach out to a licensed psychotherapist. Symptoms can present themselves differently from person to person and can change with time. In addition, you don't need a diagnosis to see a provider. Many psychotherapists can work with you based on your symptoms and goals for treatment. You can meet with a psychotherapist online if you face barriers to seeing a provider in person, such as distance, cost, or other concerns. Although many online therapists cannot make diagnoses, they can guide you in building a treatment plan and understanding yourself more profoundly. Platforms like BetterHelp connect clients with licensed, accredited psychotherapists experienced in mental health challenges. You can choose the right psychotherapist for you, and they'll work with you to develop a treatment plan on your schedule via online messaging, video chat, or phone call sessions. If you're unsure about the effectiveness of internet-based counseling, studies show that it can be as effective as in-person options. One study that reviewed 17 studies on online psychotherapy found that it was effective in reducing symptoms of common mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. One of the 17 studies showed that online treatment could be more effective than in-person options for treating depression.TakeawayThe DSM is a popular tool for diagnosing mental health conditions and providing diagnostic categories and criteria for clinicians, therapists, and insurance companies. The DSM classifies many prevalent mental health conditions. Personality disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder,dissociative disorders, and hundreds more. It also clarifies common terminology, such as autism spectrum and gender dysphoria, to create clarity across the many branches of psychology. However, the DSM is not the only diagnostic tool available, and many therapists treat symptoms individually. If you're interested in learning more about receiving a diagnosis or learning about mental health symptoms, consider reaching out to a provider in your area or online to get started.Read moreFrequently asked questions (FAQs)Below are some of the most commonly asked questions about the DSM in psychology. What is the DSM-5 definition of mental disorders?A mental disorder is a mental or psychological illness. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) website defines mental illness as "health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." What is the difference between the DSM-4 and DSM-5?The revisions made to the DSM-5 were made to improve the classification of psychological and mental health conditions. The DSM-5 includes terminology and diagnoses not present in the DSM-4, allowing more people to get an accurate diagnosis. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are no longer listed under anxiety disorders, and gender dysphoria is now considered a psychological diagnosis. The frequently asked questions page on the APA website explains the need for the changes made in the DSM-5 by saying, "Many of the changes in DSM–5 were made to characterize better symptoms and behaviors of groups of people who are currently seeking clinical help, but whose symptoms are not well defined by DSM–IV (meaning they are less likely to have to treatment). By more accurately defining disorders, we hope that diagnosis and clinical care will be improved, and new research will be facilitated to further our understanding of mental disorders."What are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual psychological categories?The categories included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) include the following: Neurodevelopmental disordersSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disordersBipolar and related disordersDepressive disordersAnxiety disordersObsessive-compulsive and related disordersTrauma and stressor-related disordersDissociative disordersSomatic symptoms and associated disordersFeeding and eating disordersElimination disordersSleep-wake disordersSexual dysfunctionsDisruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disordersSubstance-related and addictive disordersNeurocognitive disordersPersonality disordersParaphilic disordersOther mental disordersWhat does the DSM-5 stand for?"DSM-5" is the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

When diagnosing mental illness, psychologists use the DSM-5. When using everyday language, however, some people still reference diagnoses and terms used in the DSM-4. For example, people may refer to ADD, which is no longer a diagnosis in the DSM-5. Instead, ADHD has been split into three psychological categories. What is a DSM psychological category?Categories in the DSM are used to group psychological and mental health conditions. For example, eating disorders are listed under the DSM category "feeding and eating disorders," and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is under the category called "trauma and stressor-related disorders."

If you've ever seen a psychotherapist or researched mental health, you might have heard of the DSM. DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is a book used by healthcare providers to diagnose and treat clients with mental illnesses using common language, just as medical physicians have common terminology for clarity in diagnosing diseases. Learning more about how the DSM works and why it is used can offer insight into how professionals may support you in a psychotherapy or psychiatry session.GettyTherapists use the DSM to help patientsLearn more about how in online therapyWhat is DSM in psychology? The American Psychiatric Association definitionThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a tool mental health professionals use to diagnose and classify mental illnesses. The current definition of a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is "a mental health condition involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." The most recent edition of the DSM covers nearly 300 mental conditions including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, prolonged grief disorder, neurodevelopmental disorders, and disorders caused by adverse effects of medication.If you are experiencing trauma, support is available. Please see our Get Help Now page for more resources.The DSM’s development process included more than 200 researchers and clinicians, and although it has some controversy surrounding it, this tool has been used by psychologists, psychotherapists, counselors, social workers, doctors, and psychiatrists since its publishing date in 1952 by the American Psychiatric Association. In DSM history, the APA has revised it five times; the current version is the DSM-5. Since its inception, the goal of the DSM has been to accommodate the need for psychiatric canon and a standardized way of categorizing disorders that present symptoms in the population. With the field of psychology continually progressing, it is often revised to accommodate newly discovered mental illnesses, phasing out labels that no longer fit or changing terminology. Mental health professionals use the DSM to rule out, determine, and examine a client's symptoms and narrow them down to an appropriate diagnosis.

The report might be used to learn more about a condition and develop a treatment plan, although the DSM does not suggest any treatments. GettyWho can use the DSM? Trained professionals only use the DSM as a diagnostic tool in treating psychological disorders. While it is available to the public, professionals do not recommend its usage if you're not a professional. Someone may best make a psychiatric diagnosis with the experience and schooling to offer a correct diagnosis. While the DSM is used as a reference by individuals across the globe, its diagnostic criteria are primarily followed by physicians in the United States. Why has the DSM been revised so often?Due to the constant change of cultural norms and ever-evolving research, the DSM has gone through regular text revision to account for these changes and stay relevant. For example, the causes of a mental health condition may be better understood with research, and the DSM may change to reflect that cause. Since its inception, psychology has continued to evolve. Researchers and psychologists understand that certain mental health conditions may need updating or eliminating due to the change in understanding. As the techniques for treatment have expanded over the years, so must the criteria and classification of disorders. Examples of DSM updates may include more concise and accurate descriptions, appropriately outlining revised criteria, creating unbiased reports of the cause of the mental illness, updating risk and prognostic factors, and revising the descriptive language.What is the DSM controversy? Because the APA has revised the DSM many times over the years, some professionals exercise caution when using it because the limited outlines of mental illnesses may prevent the proper diagnosis of patients. Sometimes symptoms for conditions will overlap. For example, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder can have similar symptoms. In addition, symptoms may mask themselves as other conditions, or clients may not be upfront about all their symptoms. Diagnosis may not always be the most accurate tool for treatment. Many psychologists also work from a "treat the symptoms, not the condition" point of view. This can be problematic in the case of an axis II personality disorder, for instance, some symptoms of which can be difficult to differentiate from non-clinical personality traits or signs of other mental health conditions.Outdated information and information based on social and cultural biases can also be harmful. Homosexuality and gender provide an example of how, if it weren't for evolving research, clients would still receive "treatment" for these identities, which are not mental or psychological illnesses. In the early years of the DSM, homosexuality was listed as a disorder without empirical evidence to determine it as such until it was removed in 1973. Another recent example is gender dysphoria, which was referred to as “gender identity disorder” from 1980 when it was added until 2013 when it was updated.Some critics believe the DSM promotes the use of psychotropic medications as treatment for many mental illnesses for the financial gain of pharmaceutical companies. Many critics presume that the descriptions and requirements for diagnosis are deliberately broad for pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of potential patients. A few of the authors of the DSM in the past have been involved financially with these institutions, so this issue has been considered a conflict of interest in history. Despite these controversies, the DSM remains a trusted tool for researchers and clinicians looking for updated ways to diagnose and treat illnesses. The breadth and scope of research and contributions from mental health professionals worldwide make it a resource that can offer practical guidance. However, many psychotherapists also use the ICD manual for psychological diagnosis, which may be the primary guide in other countries. How do psychologists make a diagnosis? Diagnosing a mental illness can be a multi-step process. The professional psychologist or psychiatrist you meet with may evaluate your physical health, current medical condition, and any history of diseases from you or your family. For further study, they may present you with a questionnaire and ask you questions about your symptoms, background, and any thoughts you may have about your symptoms. They can then use the information gathered from this process and the DSM-5 to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan.

Symptoms can present themselves differently from person to person and can change with time. In addition, you don't need a diagnosis to see a provider. Many psychotherapists can work with you based on your symptoms and goals for treatment. You can meet with a psychotherapist online if you face barriers to seeing a provider in person, such as distance, cost, or other concerns.

One study that reviewed 17 studies on online psychotherapy found that it was effective in reducing symptoms of common mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. One of the 17 studies showed that online treatment could be more effective than in-person options for treating depression.TakeawayThe DSM is a popular tool for diagnosing mental health conditions and providing diagnostic categories and criteria for clinicians, therapists, and insurance companies. The DSM classifies many prevalent mental health conditions. Personality disorders, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder,dissociative disorders, and hundreds more. It also clarifies common terminology, such as autism spectrum and gender dysphoria, to create clarity across the many branches of psychology. However, the DSM is not the only diagnostic tool available, and many therapists treat symptoms individually. If you're interested in learning more about receiving a diagnosis or learning about mental health symptoms, consider reaching out to a provider in your area or online to get started.Read moreFrequently asked questions (FAQs)Below are some of the most commonly asked questions about the DSM in psychology. What is the DSM-5 definition of mental disorders?A mental disorder is a mental or psychological illness. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) website defines mental illness as "health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." What is the difference between the DSM-4 and DSM-5?The revisions made to the DSM-5 were made to improve the classification of psychological and mental health conditions. The DSM-5 includes terminology and diagnoses not present in the DSM-4, allowing more people to get an accurate diagnosis. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are no longer listed under anxiety disorders, and gender dysphoria is now considered a psychological diagnosis. The frequently asked questions page on the APA website explains the need for the changes made in the DSM-5 by saying, "Many of the changes in DSM–5 were made to characterize better symptoms and behaviors of groups of people who are currently seeking clinical help, but whose symptoms are not well defined by DSM–IV (meaning they are less likely to have to treatment). By more accurately defining disorders, we hope that diagnosis and clinical care will be improved, and new research will be facilitated to further our understanding of mental disorders."What are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual psychological categories?The categories included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) include the following: Neurodevelopmental disordersSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disordersBipolar and related disordersDepressive disordersAnxiety disordersObsessive-compulsive and related disordersTrauma and stressor-related disordersDissociative disordersSomatic symptoms and associated disordersFeeding and eating disordersElimination disordersSleep-wake disordersSexual dysfunctionsDisruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disordersSubstance-related and addictive disordersNeurocognitive disordersPersonality disordersParaphilic disordersOther mental disordersWhat does the DSM-5 stand for?"DSM-5" is the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The DSM-5 was released in 2013, whereas the DSM-4 was released in 1994.Is the DSM-4 still used?The DSM-4 isn't used in clinical settings and is no longer used for diagnosing mental disorders. When diagnosing mental illness, psychologists use the DSM-5. When using everyday language, however, some people still reference diagnoses and terms used in the DSM-4. For example, people may refer to ADD, which is no longer a diagnosis in the DSM-5. Instead, ADHD has been split into three psychological categories. What is a DSM psychological category?Categories in the DSM are used to group psychological and mental health conditions. For example, eating disorders are listed under the DSM category "feeding and eating disorders," and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is under the category called "trauma and stressor-related disorders." Therapists, psychiatrists, general doctors, and those in the field of social work may reference the DSM. Clients, families, and clients seeking general or basic mental health information do not necessarily need to know all the details of the DSM categories. Still, the DSM-5 is often available in PDF format online.What mental disorders are in the DSM-5?There are hundreds of mental illnesses listed in the DSM-5. These conditions include but aren't limited to the following:Depressive disorders Anxiety disorders Eating disorders Dissociative disorders Substance use disordersPersonality disordersIs the DSM reliable?The DSM can be reliable.

If you've ever seen a psychotherapist or researched mental health, you might have heard of the DSM. DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is a book used by healthcare providers to diagnose and treat clients with mental illnesses using common language, just as medical physicians have common terminology for clarity in diagnosing diseases. Learning more about how the DSM works and why it is used can offer insight into how professionals may support you in a psychotherapy or psychiatry session.GettyTherapists use the DSM to help patientsLearn more about how in online therapyWhat is DSM in psychology? The American Psychiatric Association definitionThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a tool mental health professionals use to diagnose and classify mental illnesses. The current definition of a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is "a mental health condition involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." The most recent edition of the DSM covers nearly 300 mental conditions including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, prolonged grief disorder, neurodevelopmental disorders, and disorders caused by adverse effects of medication.If you are experiencing trauma, support is available. Please see our Get Help Now page for more resources.The DSM’s development process included more than 200 researchers and clinicians, and although it has some controversy surrounding it, this tool has been used by psychologists, psychotherapists, counselors, social workers, doctors, and psychiatrists since its publishing date in 1952 by the American Psychiatric Association. In DSM history, the APA has revised it five times; the current version is the DSM-5. Since its inception, the goal of the DSM has been to accommodate the need for psychiatric canon and a standardized way of categorizing disorders that present symptoms in the population. With the field of psychology continually progressing, it is often revised to accommodate newly discovered mental illnesses, phasing out labels that no longer fit or changing terminology. Mental health professionals use the DSM to rule out, determine, and examine a client's symptoms and narrow them down to an appropriate diagnosis. It is also helpful in explaining symptoms and diagnostic criteria to clients and knowing how to direct treatment.Though the DSM helps professionals classify mental illness, it does not offer treatment options for curious readers. Professionals use the tool only as a reference. In addition, insurance companies may require diagnostic codes for billing purposes. The DSM also provides a basis for research and treatment to further the study of psychology. This tool allows clinicians and researchers to develop new ways to combat symptoms and treat disorders.How is the DSM organized?The American Psychiatric Association separates the DSM into three sections: Diagnostic classificationDiagnostic criteria sets DescriptionsDiagnostic classification The first section of the DSM involves a complete list of all psychiatric disorders. In addition, it lists codes for health professionals to use for diagnostic and billing purposes. This section may differ from the rules in the ICD, the International Classification of Diseases.There are numerous categories in the DSM-V, including Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders, Bipolar and Related Disorders, Personality Disorders, and Depressive Disorders. Within these categories are several sub-categories. For example, under the category Neurodevelopmental Disorders are the sub-categories Intellectual Disorders, Communication Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Classifications of certain disorders have changed over the years, and new categories have been created to reflect developments in experts’ understanding of these mental health conditions. For example, bipolar disorders were listed under the category of Mood Disorders in the DSM-IV. In the DSM-V, however, a new category was created specifically for the subtypes of bipolar disorder—Bipolar and Other Disorders—further differentiating them from conditions like major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. The names of certain disorders have also changed in the DSM over time. For example, the term autism spectrum disorder is used in the DSM-V to encompass four previously distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. This change echoes the stated views of many experts that the conditions—autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified—are actually different manifestations of the same disorder. The DSM-V also allows physicians to add a severity specifier to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Diagnostic criteria sets The second section of the DSM focuses on the methods of identifying mental illness. In this section, the clinician references how the client's presenting symptoms match the existing criteria outlined in the manual regarding behaviors, feelings, and the time the symptoms present for a diagnosis to occur. They may use the requirements to make a diagnosis of mental disorders. Some clients may have symptoms from more than one diagnosis. Descriptions The third section of the manual includes emerging measures and models, which go into a further description of each disorder and its subsets.

What is the DSM-5 definition of mental disorders?A mental disorder is a mental or psychological illness. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) website defines mental illness as "health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." What is the difference between the DSM-4 and DSM-5?The revisions made to the DSM-5 were made to improve the classification of psychological and mental health conditions. The DSM-5 includes terminology and diagnoses not present in the DSM-4, allowing more people to get an accurate diagnosis. For example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are no longer listed under anxiety disorders, and gender dysphoria is now considered a psychological diagnosis. The frequently asked questions page on the APA website explains the need for the changes made in the DSM-5 by saying, "Many of the changes in DSM–5 were made to characterize better symptoms and behaviors of groups of people who are currently seeking clinical help, but whose symptoms are not well defined by DSM–IV (meaning they are less likely to have to treatment). By more accurately defining disorders, we hope that diagnosis and clinical care will be improved, and new research will be facilitated to further our understanding of mental disorders."What are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual psychological categories?The categories included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) include the following: Neurodevelopmental disordersSchizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disordersBipolar and related disordersDepressive disordersAnxiety disordersObsessive-compulsive and related disordersTrauma and stressor-related disordersDissociative disordersSomatic symptoms and associated disordersFeeding and eating disordersElimination disordersSleep-wake disordersSexual dysfunctionsDisruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disordersSubstance-related and addictive disordersNeurocognitive disordersPersonality disordersParaphilic disordersOther mental disordersWhat does the DSM-5 stand for?"DSM-5" is the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

When diagnosing mental illness, psychologists use the DSM-5. When using everyday language, however, some people still reference diagnoses and terms used in the DSM-4. For example, people may refer to ADD, which is no longer a diagnosis in the DSM-5. Instead, ADHD has been split into three psychological categories. What is a DSM psychological category?Categories in the DSM are used to group psychological and mental health conditions. For example, eating disorders are listed under the DSM category "feeding and eating disorders," and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is under the category called "trauma and stressor-related disorders." Therapists, psychiatrists, general doctors, and those in the field of social work may reference the DSM. Clients, families, and clients seeking general or basic mental health information do not necessarily need to know all the details of the DSM categories. Still, the DSM-5 is often available in PDF format online.What mental disorders are in the DSM-5?There are hundreds of mental illnesses listed in the DSM-5. These conditions include but aren't limited to the following:Depressive disorders Anxiety disorders Eating disorders Dissociative disorders Substance use disordersPersonality disordersIs the DSM reliable?The DSM can be reliable.

If you've ever seen a psychotherapist or researched mental health, you might have heard of the DSM. DSM stands for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and is a book used by healthcare providers to diagnose and treat clients with mental illnesses using common language, just as medical physicians have common terminology for clarity in diagnosing diseases.

The American Psychiatric Association definitionThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a tool mental health professionals use to diagnose and classify mental illnesses. The current definition of a mental illness by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is "a mental health condition involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these)." The most recent edition of the DSM covers nearly 300 mental conditions including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, prolonged grief disorder, neurodevelopmental disorders, and disorders caused by adverse effects of medication.If you are experiencing trauma, support is available. Please see our Get Help Now page for more resources.The DSM’s development process included more than 200 researchers and clinicians, and although it has some controversy surrounding it, this tool has been used by psychologists, psychotherapists, counselors, social workers, doctors, and psychiatrists since its publishing date in 1952 by the American Psychiatric Association. In DSM history, the APA has revised it five times; the current version is the DSM-5. Since its inception, the goal of the DSM has been to accommodate the need for psychiatric canon and a standardized way of categorizing disorders that present symptoms in the population. With the field of psychology continually progressing, it is often revised to accommodate newly discovered mental illnesses, phasing out labels that no longer fit or changing terminology. Mental health professionals use the DSM to rule out, determine, and examine a client's symptoms and narrow them down to an appropriate diagnosis. It is also helpful in explaining symptoms and diagnostic criteria to clients and knowing how to direct treatment.Though the DSM helps professionals classify mental illness, it does not offer treatment options for curious readers. Professionals use the tool only as a reference. In addition, insurance companies may require diagnostic codes for billing purposes. The DSM also provides a basis for research and treatment to further the study of psychology. This tool allows clinicians and researchers to develop new ways to combat symptoms and treat disorders.How is the DSM organized?The American Psychiatric Association separates the DSM into three sections: Diagnostic classificationDiagnostic criteria sets DescriptionsDiagnostic classification The first section of the DSM involves a complete list of all psychiatric disorders. In addition, it lists codes for health professionals to use for diagnostic and billing purposes. This section may differ from the rules in the ICD, the International Classification of Diseases.There are numerous categories in the DSM-V, including Neurodevelopmental Disorders, Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders, Bipolar and Related Disorders, Personality Disorders, and Depressive Disorders. Within these categories are several sub-categories. For example, under the category Neurodevelopmental Disorders are the sub-categories Intellectual Disorders, Communication Disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Classifications of certain disorders have changed over the years, and new categories have been created to reflect developments in experts’ understanding of these mental health conditions. For example, bipolar disorders were listed under the category of Mood Disorders in the DSM-IV. In the DSM-V, however, a new category was created specifically for the subtypes of bipolar disorder—Bipolar and Other Disorders—further differentiating them from conditions like major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. The names of certain disorders have also changed in the DSM over time. For example, the term autism spectrum disorder is used in the DSM-V to encompass four previously distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. This change echoes the stated views of many experts that the conditions—autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified—are actually different manifestations of the same disorder. The DSM-V also allows physicians to add a severity specifier to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Diagnostic criteria sets The second section of the DSM focuses on the methods of identifying mental illness. In this section, the clinician references how the client's presenting symptoms match the existing criteria outlined in the manual regarding behaviors, feelings, and the time the symptoms present for a diagnosis to occur. They may use the requirements to make a diagnosis of mental disorders. Some clients may have symptoms from more than one diagnosis. Descriptions The third section of the manual includes emerging measures and models, which go into a further description of each disorder and its subsets. It also includes information about how cultural influences or cultural differences could affect a diagnosis. The report might be used to learn more about a condition and develop a treatment plan, although the DSM does not suggest any treatments. GettyWho can use the DSM? Trained professionals only use the DSM as a diagnostic tool in treating psychological disorders. While it is available to the public, professionals do not recommend its usage if you're not a professional. Someone may best make a psychiatric diagnosis with the experience and schooling to offer a correct diagnosis. While the DSM is used as a reference by individuals across the globe, its diagnostic criteria are primarily followed by physicians in the United States. Why has the DSM been revised so often?Due to the constant change of cultural norms and ever-evolving research, the DSM has gone through regular text revision to account for these changes and stay relevant. For example, the causes of a mental health condition may be better understood with research, and the DSM may change to reflect that cause. Since its inception, psychology has continued to evolve. Researchers and psychologists understand that certain mental health conditions may need updating or eliminating due to the change in understanding. As the techniques for treatment have expanded over the years, so must the criteria and classification of disorders. Examples of DSM updates may include more concise and accurate descriptions, appropriately outlining revised criteria, creating unbiased reports of the cause of the mental illness, updating risk and prognostic factors, and revising the descriptive language.What is the DSM controversy? Because the APA has revised the DSM many times over the years, some professionals exercise caution when using it because the limited outlines of mental illnesses may prevent the proper diagnosis of patients. Sometimes symptoms for conditions will overlap. For example, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder can have similar symptoms. In addition, symptoms may mask themselves as other conditions, or clients may not be upfront about all their symptoms. Diagnosis may not always be the most accurate tool for treatment. Many psychologists also work from a "treat the symptoms, not the condition" point of view. This can be problematic in the case of an axis II personality disorder, for instance, some symptoms of which can be difficult to differentiate from non-clinical personality traits or signs of other mental health conditions.Outdated information and information based on social and cultural biases can also be harmful. Homosexuality and gender provide an example of how, if it weren't for evolving research, clients would still receive "treatment" for these identities, which are not mental or psychological illnesses. In the early years of the DSM, homosexuality was listed as a disorder without empirical evidence to determine it as such until it was removed in 1973. Another recent example is gender dysphoria, which was referred to as “gender identity disorder” from 1980 when it was added until 2013 when it was updated.Some critics believe the DSM promotes the use of psychotropic medications as treatment for many mental illnesses for the financial gain of pharmaceutical companies. Many critics presume that the descriptions and requirements for diagnosis are deliberately broad for pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of potential patients. A few of the authors of the DSM in the past have been involved financially with these institutions, so this issue has been considered a conflict of interest in history. Despite these controversies, the DSM remains a trusted tool for researchers and clinicians looking for updated ways to diagnose and treat illnesses. The breadth and scope of research and contributions from mental health professionals worldwide make it a resource that can offer practical guidance. However, many psychotherapists also use the ICD manual for psychological diagnosis, which may be the primary guide in other countries. How do psychologists make a diagnosis?
