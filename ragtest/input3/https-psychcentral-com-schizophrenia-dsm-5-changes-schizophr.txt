This has helped mental health professionals provide a more reliable diagnosis.Schizophrenia changes how people think, feel, and behave. It causes them to see reality differently than others.It’s a serious mental illness that affects approximately 3.2 million Americans. Still, with proper treatment, a person with schizophrenia can be successful in school and work and enjoy a fulfilling personal life.In 2013, the way schizophrenia is diagnosed changed, and its formal name was revised from just “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder.” This allows healthcare professionals to diagnose the condition based on the severity of symptoms. These changes were created by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and published in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5).The changes didn’t affect people who were already diagnosed with the condition. In fact, since that time, researchers have shown that over 99.5% of people who received a schizophrenia diagnosis before the DSM-5 was published still qualified for a diagnosis.Instead, these changes involved creating a new set of guidelines for mental health professionals. They were created to guarantee a more reliable diagnosis.Symptoms and other criteria: What has changed?When it comes to symptoms and other criteria for diagnosis, most differences between the fourth edition (DSM-4) and fifth edition (DSM-5) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders are minor changes in wording. The five key symptoms of schizophrenia remained the same:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechdisorganized or catatonic behaviornegative symptoms (not expressing any feelings or emotions)However, the number of symptoms needed for diagnosis was changed. This is one of the biggest revisions from the DSM-4 to the DSM-5.Previously, you needed to have at least two of the above symptoms to receive a diagnosis. But, your doctor could also diagnose schizophrenia if you had only one symptom and also experienced either “bizarre” delusions or hallucinations that included “a running commentary on a person’s thoughts/behavior, and/or two or more voices conversing.”The DSM-5 removed the second criteria because experts decided that it wasn’t very specific. Also, it’s difficult to determine what is and isn’t considered “bizarre.”Now, for a doctor to diagnose schizophrenia, an individual must have at least two symptoms, and at least one of those symptoms must be one of the first three:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechWhat about subtypes?In the DSM-4, the condition’s full name was “Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.” Under this condition, there were five subtypes of schizophrenia. When a healthcare professional diagnosed schizophrenia, the person receiving the diagnosis was placed into one of the following subtypes.Catatonic typePeople with this subtype must have at least two of these symptoms:They don’t move much or at all.They experience a lot of unusual movements that don’t seem to have a purpose.They refuse to do things or speak.They choose to put themselves in strange positions or show stereotypical movements, very noticeable gestures, or very noticeable grimacing.They experience echolalia (repeating what others say) or echopraxia (repeating how others move).Disorganized typePeople with this subtype must:have disorganized speechhave disorganized behaviorexpress no feelings or emotionsParanoid typePeople with this subtype must have:one or more delusional thoughts that they think about regularly, or sounds they hear regularly that don’t existno symptoms of “catatonic” or “disorganized” typeResidual typePeople with this subtype don’t have the very noticeable symptoms of the other types, but evidence suggests that they have schizophrenia because they have negative symptoms or two more symptoms of schizophrenia that are not as strong, such as odd beliefs or strange experiences.Undifferentiated typePeople with this subtype don’t have symptoms that meet the criteria of the other types, but do have the main symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia.Why the subtypes were removedWith the release of the DSM-5, these subtypes were removed for several reasons:They weren’t very reliable descriptions.People living with schizophrenia didn’t always experience the same symptoms or subtype.There was no difference in brain functioning between the subtypes.The subtypes didn’t help predict how the condition would play out over time.Some people couldn’t be assigned a subtype based on their symptoms.They didn’t help with treatment decisions.Scientists had stopped using the subtypes in their reports.Instead, the APA believed it was more accurate to describe the symptoms of schizophrenia as a spectrum. This means that people with schizophrenia may experience different symptoms at different times. It also means that not everyone with a schizophrenia diagnosis experiences the same symptoms.This is why the condition is now called “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Disorders” in the DSM-5, compared with just “Schizophrenia and Other Disorders” in the DSM-4.Symptom ratingsDue to the change from “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder,” a person’s condition is now described based on how severe their symptoms are.The symptom ratings are not required to diagnose schizophrenia. But, doctors use them to clearly identify what the person is experiencing and what treatment should work best.The symptoms that are rated include:reality distortion (having delusions or hallucinations)negative symptoms (for example, whether the person doesn’t express as much emotion or lacks any motivation to do things)disorganizationcognitive impairment (trouble remembering or learning new things, can’t concentrate, has a hard time making decisions)motor symptoms (doesn’t move in a normal way)mood symptoms (experiences episodes of depression or mania)Since these symptoms can now be rated, there is also a new rating scale in the DSM-5. The ratings are based on how severe the symptom has been during the last 7 days and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms).Because a person with schizophrenia may have different episodes, their symptoms and the ratings can change over time.

Also, it’s difficult to determine what is and isn’t considered “bizarre.”Now, for a doctor to diagnose schizophrenia, an individual must have at least two symptoms, and at least one of those symptoms must be one of the first three:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechWhat about subtypes?In the DSM-4, the condition’s full name was “Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.” Under this condition, there were five subtypes of schizophrenia. When a healthcare professional diagnosed schizophrenia, the person receiving the diagnosis was placed into one of the following subtypes.Catatonic typePeople with this subtype must have at least two of these symptoms:They don’t move much or at all.They experience a lot of unusual movements that don’t seem to have a purpose.They refuse to do things or speak.They choose to put themselves in strange positions or show stereotypical movements, very noticeable gestures, or very noticeable grimacing.They experience echolalia (repeating what others say) or echopraxia (repeating how others move).Disorganized typePeople with this subtype must:have disorganized speechhave disorganized behaviorexpress no feelings or emotionsParanoid typePeople with this subtype must have:one or more delusional thoughts that they think about regularly, or sounds they hear regularly that don’t existno symptoms of “catatonic” or “disorganized” typeResidual typePeople with this subtype don’t have the very noticeable symptoms of the other types, but evidence suggests that they have schizophrenia because they have negative symptoms or two more symptoms of schizophrenia that are not as strong, such as odd beliefs or strange experiences.Undifferentiated typePeople with this subtype don’t have symptoms that meet the criteria of the other types, but do have the main symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia.Why the subtypes were removedWith the release of the DSM-5, these subtypes were removed for several reasons:They weren’t very reliable descriptions.People living with schizophrenia didn’t always experience the same symptoms or subtype.There was no difference in brain functioning between the subtypes.The subtypes didn’t help predict how the condition would play out over time.Some people couldn’t be assigned a subtype based on their symptoms.They didn’t help with treatment decisions.Scientists had stopped using the subtypes in their reports.Instead, the APA believed it was more accurate to describe the symptoms of schizophrenia as a spectrum. This means that people with schizophrenia may experience different symptoms at different times. It also means that not everyone with a schizophrenia diagnosis experiences the same symptoms.This is why the condition is now called “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Disorders” in the DSM-5, compared with just “Schizophrenia and Other Disorders” in the DSM-4.Symptom ratingsDue to the change from “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder,” a person’s condition is now described based on how severe their symptoms are.The symptom ratings are not required to diagnose schizophrenia. But, doctors use them to clearly identify what the person is experiencing and what treatment should work best.The symptoms that are rated include:reality distortion (having delusions or hallucinations)negative symptoms (for example, whether the person doesn’t express as much emotion or lacks any motivation to do things)disorganizationcognitive impairment (trouble remembering or learning new things, can’t concentrate, has a hard time making decisions)motor symptoms (doesn’t move in a normal way)mood symptoms (experiences episodes of depression or mania)Since these symptoms can now be rated, there is also a new rating scale in the DSM-5. The ratings are based on how severe the symptom has been during the last 7 days and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms).Because a person with schizophrenia may have different episodes, their symptoms and the ratings can change over time.

DSM-5 Changes: Schizophrenia and Schizophrenia Spectrum DisorderMedically reviewed by Alex Klein, PsyD — Written by Gia Miller — Updated on May 18, 2021Symptoms and other criteriaSubtypesSymptom ratingsOverview tableTakeawayThe DSM-5 modified the guidelines for diagnosing schizophrenia. This has helped mental health professionals provide a more reliable diagnosis.Schizophrenia changes how people think, feel, and behave. It causes them to see reality differently than others.It’s a serious mental illness that affects approximately 3.2 million Americans. Still, with proper treatment, a person with schizophrenia can be successful in school and work and enjoy a fulfilling personal life.In 2013, the way schizophrenia is diagnosed changed, and its formal name was revised from just “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder.” This allows healthcare professionals to diagnose the condition based on the severity of symptoms. These changes were created by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and published in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5).The changes didn’t affect people who were already diagnosed with the condition. In fact, since that time, researchers have shown that over 99.5% of people who received a schizophrenia diagnosis before the DSM-5 was published still qualified for a diagnosis.Instead, these changes involved creating a new set of guidelines for mental health professionals. They were created to guarantee a more reliable diagnosis.Symptoms and other criteria: What has changed?When it comes to symptoms and other criteria for diagnosis, most differences between the fourth edition (DSM-4) and fifth edition (DSM-5) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders are minor changes in wording. The five key symptoms of schizophrenia remained the same:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechdisorganized or catatonic behaviornegative symptoms (not expressing any feelings or emotions)However, the number of symptoms needed for diagnosis was changed. This is one of the biggest revisions from the DSM-4 to the DSM-5.Previously, you needed to have at least two of the above symptoms to receive a diagnosis. But, your doctor could also diagnose schizophrenia if you had only one symptom and also experienced either “bizarre” delusions or hallucinations that included “a running commentary on a person’s thoughts/behavior, and/or two or more voices conversing.”The DSM-5 removed the second criteria because experts decided that it wasn’t very specific. Also, it’s difficult to determine what is and isn’t considered “bizarre.”Now, for a doctor to diagnose schizophrenia, an individual must have at least two symptoms, and at least one of those symptoms must be one of the first three:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechWhat about subtypes?In the DSM-4, the condition’s full name was “Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.” Under this condition, there were five subtypes of schizophrenia. When a healthcare professional diagnosed schizophrenia, the person receiving the diagnosis was placed into one of the following subtypes.Catatonic typePeople with this subtype must have at least two of these symptoms:They don’t move much or at all.They experience a lot of unusual movements that don’t seem to have a purpose.They refuse to do things or speak.They choose to put themselves in strange positions or show stereotypical movements, very noticeable gestures, or very noticeable grimacing.They experience echolalia (repeating what others say) or echopraxia (repeating how others move).Disorganized typePeople with this subtype must:have disorganized speechhave disorganized behaviorexpress no feelings or emotionsParanoid typePeople with this subtype must have:one or more delusional thoughts that they think about regularly, or sounds they hear regularly that don’t existno symptoms of “catatonic” or “disorganized” typeResidual typePeople with this subtype don’t have the very noticeable symptoms of the other types, but evidence suggests that they have schizophrenia because they have negative symptoms or two more symptoms of schizophrenia that are not as strong, such as odd beliefs or strange experiences.Undifferentiated typePeople with this subtype don’t have symptoms that meet the criteria of the other types, but do have the main symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia.Why the subtypes were removedWith the release of the DSM-5, these subtypes were removed for several reasons:They weren’t very reliable descriptions.People living with schizophrenia didn’t always experience the same symptoms or subtype.There was no difference in brain functioning between the subtypes.The subtypes didn’t help predict how the condition would play out over time.Some people couldn’t be assigned a subtype based on their symptoms.They didn’t help with treatment decisions.Scientists had stopped using the subtypes in their reports.Instead, the APA believed it was more accurate to describe the symptoms of schizophrenia as a spectrum. This means that people with schizophrenia may experience different symptoms at different times.

But, doctors use them to clearly identify what the person is experiencing and what treatment should work best.The symptoms that are rated include:reality distortion (having delusions or hallucinations)negative symptoms (for example, whether the person doesn’t express as much emotion or lacks any motivation to do things)disorganizationcognitive impairment (trouble remembering or learning new things, can’t concentrate, has a hard time making decisions)motor symptoms (doesn’t move in a normal way)mood symptoms (experiences episodes of depression or mania)Since these symptoms can now be rated, there is also a new rating scale in the DSM-5. The ratings are based on how severe the symptom has been during the last 7 days and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms).Because a person with schizophrenia may have different episodes, their symptoms and the ratings can change over time.

This has helped mental health professionals provide a more reliable diagnosis.Schizophrenia changes how people think, feel, and behave. It causes them to see reality differently than others.It’s a serious mental illness that affects approximately 3.2 million Americans. Still, with proper treatment, a person with schizophrenia can be successful in school and work and enjoy a fulfilling personal life.In 2013, the way schizophrenia is diagnosed changed, and its formal name was revised from just “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder.” This allows healthcare professionals to diagnose the condition based on the severity of symptoms. These changes were created by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and published in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5).The changes didn’t affect people who were already diagnosed with the condition. In fact, since that time, researchers have shown that over 99.5% of people who received a schizophrenia diagnosis before the DSM-5 was published still qualified for a diagnosis.Instead, these changes involved creating a new set of guidelines for mental health professionals. They were created to guarantee a more reliable diagnosis.Symptoms and other criteria: What has changed?When it comes to symptoms and other criteria for diagnosis, most differences between the fourth edition (DSM-4) and fifth edition (DSM-5) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders are minor changes in wording. The five key symptoms of schizophrenia remained the same:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechdisorganized or catatonic behaviornegative symptoms (not expressing any feelings or emotions)However, the number of symptoms needed for diagnosis was changed. This is one of the biggest revisions from the DSM-4 to the DSM-5.Previously, you needed to have at least two of the above symptoms to receive a diagnosis. But, your doctor could also diagnose schizophrenia if you had only one symptom and also experienced either “bizarre” delusions or hallucinations that included “a running commentary on a person’s thoughts/behavior, and/or two or more voices conversing.”The DSM-5 removed the second criteria because experts decided that it wasn’t very specific. Also, it’s difficult to determine what is and isn’t considered “bizarre.”Now, for a doctor to diagnose schizophrenia, an individual must have at least two symptoms, and at least one of those symptoms must be one of the first three:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechWhat about subtypes?In the DSM-4, the condition’s full name was “Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.” Under this condition, there were five subtypes of schizophrenia. When a healthcare professional diagnosed schizophrenia, the person receiving the diagnosis was placed into one of the following subtypes.Catatonic typePeople with this subtype must have at least two of these symptoms:They don’t move much or at all.They experience a lot of unusual movements that don’t seem to have a purpose.They refuse to do things or speak.They choose to put themselves in strange positions or show stereotypical movements, very noticeable gestures, or very noticeable grimacing.They experience echolalia (repeating what others say) or echopraxia (repeating how others move).Disorganized typePeople with this subtype must:have disorganized speechhave disorganized behaviorexpress no feelings or emotionsParanoid typePeople with this subtype must have:one or more delusional thoughts that they think about regularly, or sounds they hear regularly that don’t existno symptoms of “catatonic” or “disorganized” typeResidual typePeople with this subtype don’t have the very noticeable symptoms of the other types, but evidence suggests that they have schizophrenia because they have negative symptoms or two more symptoms of schizophrenia that are not as strong, such as odd beliefs or strange experiences.Undifferentiated typePeople with this subtype don’t have symptoms that meet the criteria of the other types, but do have the main symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia.Why the subtypes were removedWith the release of the DSM-5, these subtypes were removed for several reasons:They weren’t very reliable descriptions.People living with schizophrenia didn’t always experience the same symptoms or subtype.There was no difference in brain functioning between the subtypes.The subtypes didn’t help predict how the condition would play out over time.Some people couldn’t be assigned a subtype based on their symptoms.They didn’t help with treatment decisions.Scientists had stopped using the subtypes in their reports.Instead, the APA believed it was more accurate to describe the symptoms of schizophrenia as a spectrum. This means that people with schizophrenia may experience different symptoms at different times. It also means that not everyone with a schizophrenia diagnosis experiences the same symptoms.This is why the condition is now called “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Disorders” in the DSM-5, compared with just “Schizophrenia and Other Disorders” in the DSM-4.Symptom ratingsDue to the change from “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder,” a person’s condition is now described based on how severe their symptoms are.The symptom ratings are not required to diagnose schizophrenia. But, doctors use them to clearly identify what the person is experiencing and what treatment should work best.The symptoms that are rated include:reality distortion (having delusions or hallucinations)negative symptoms (for example, whether the person doesn’t express as much emotion or lacks any motivation to do things)disorganizationcognitive impairment (trouble remembering or learning new things, can’t concentrate, has a hard time making decisions)motor symptoms (doesn’t move in a normal way)mood symptoms (experiences episodes of depression or mania)Since these symptoms can now be rated, there is also a new rating scale in the DSM-5. The ratings are based on how severe the symptom has been during the last 7 days and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms).Because a person with schizophrenia may have different episodes, their symptoms and the ratings can change over time.

Males tend to first show symptoms when they’re at the end of their teenage years or in their early 20s. Women don’t usually show symptoms until their early 20s through their early 30s.The first changes happen slowly and may begin years before they have their first episode of psychosis. Once a person has received a schizophrenia diagnosis, they will have the condition throughout their life.If you think that you or a loved one may have symptoms of schizophrenia, consider taking our schizophrenia test to learn more.You can also reach out to a trusted healthcare provider.

Symptoms and other criteriaSubtypesSymptom ratingsOverview tableTakeawayThe DSM-5 modified the guidelines for diagnosing schizophrenia. This has helped mental health professionals provide a more reliable diagnosis.Schizophrenia changes how people think, feel, and behave. It causes them to see reality differently than others.It’s a serious mental illness that affects approximately 3.2 million Americans. Still, with proper treatment, a person with schizophrenia can be successful in school and work and enjoy a fulfilling personal life.In 2013, the way schizophrenia is diagnosed changed, and its formal name was revised from just “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder.” This allows healthcare professionals to diagnose the condition based on the severity of symptoms. These changes were created by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and published in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5).The changes didn’t affect people who were already diagnosed with the condition. In fact, since that time, researchers have shown that over 99.5% of people who received a schizophrenia diagnosis before the DSM-5 was published still qualified for a diagnosis.Instead, these changes involved creating a new set of guidelines for mental health professionals. They were created to guarantee a more reliable diagnosis.Symptoms and other criteria: What has changed?When it comes to symptoms and other criteria for diagnosis, most differences between the fourth edition (DSM-4) and fifth edition (DSM-5) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders are minor changes in wording. The five key symptoms of schizophrenia remained the same:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechdisorganized or catatonic behaviornegative symptoms (not expressing any feelings or emotions)However, the number of symptoms needed for diagnosis was changed. This is one of the biggest revisions from the DSM-4 to the DSM-5.Previously, you needed to have at least two of the above symptoms to receive a diagnosis. But, your doctor could also diagnose schizophrenia if you had only one symptom and also experienced either “bizarre” delusions or hallucinations that included “a running commentary on a person’s thoughts/behavior, and/or two or more voices conversing.”The DSM-5 removed the second criteria because experts decided that it wasn’t very specific. Also, it’s difficult to determine what is and isn’t considered “bizarre.”Now, for a doctor to diagnose schizophrenia, an individual must have at least two symptoms, and at least one of those symptoms must be one of the first three:delusionshallucinationsdisorganized speechWhat about subtypes?In the DSM-4, the condition’s full name was “Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.” Under this condition, there were five subtypes of schizophrenia. When a healthcare professional diagnosed schizophrenia, the person receiving the diagnosis was placed into one of the following subtypes.Catatonic typePeople with this subtype must have at least two of these symptoms:They don’t move much or at all.They experience a lot of unusual movements that don’t seem to have a purpose.They refuse to do things or speak.They choose to put themselves in strange positions or show stereotypical movements, very noticeable gestures, or very noticeable grimacing.They experience echolalia (repeating what others say) or echopraxia (repeating how others move).Disorganized typePeople with this subtype must:have disorganized speechhave disorganized behaviorexpress no feelings or emotionsParanoid typePeople with this subtype must have:one or more delusional thoughts that they think about regularly, or sounds they hear regularly that don’t existno symptoms of “catatonic” or “disorganized” typeResidual typePeople with this subtype don’t have the very noticeable symptoms of the other types, but evidence suggests that they have schizophrenia because they have negative symptoms or two more symptoms of schizophrenia that are not as strong, such as odd beliefs or strange experiences.Undifferentiated typePeople with this subtype don’t have symptoms that meet the criteria of the other types, but do have the main symptoms that meet the criteria for schizophrenia.Why the subtypes were removedWith the release of the DSM-5, these subtypes were removed for several reasons:They weren’t very reliable descriptions.People living with schizophrenia didn’t always experience the same symptoms or subtype.There was no difference in brain functioning between the subtypes.The subtypes didn’t help predict how the condition would play out over time.Some people couldn’t be assigned a subtype based on their symptoms.They didn’t help with treatment decisions.Scientists had stopped using the subtypes in their reports.Instead, the APA believed it was more accurate to describe the symptoms of schizophrenia as a spectrum. This means that people with schizophrenia may experience different symptoms at different times. It also means that not everyone with a schizophrenia diagnosis experiences the same symptoms.This is why the condition is now called “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Disorders” in the DSM-5, compared with just “Schizophrenia and Other Disorders” in the DSM-4.Symptom ratingsDue to the change from “schizophrenia” to “schizophrenia spectrum disorder,” a person’s condition is now described based on how severe their symptoms are.The symptom ratings are not required to diagnose schizophrenia. But, doctors use them to clearly identify what the person is experiencing and what treatment should work best.The symptoms that are rated include:reality distortion (having delusions or hallucinations)negative symptoms (for example, whether the person doesn’t express as much emotion or lacks any motivation to do things)disorganizationcognitive impairment (trouble remembering or learning new things, can’t concentrate, has a hard time making decisions)motor symptoms (doesn’t move in a normal way)mood symptoms (experiences episodes of depression or mania)Since these symptoms can now be rated, there is also a new rating scale in the DSM-5. The ratings are based on how severe the symptom has been during the last 7 days and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms).Because a person with schizophrenia may have different episodes, their symptoms and the ratings can change over time.
