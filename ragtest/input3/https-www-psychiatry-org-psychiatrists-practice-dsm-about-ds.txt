It involved more than 200 experts, the majority of whom were involved in the development of DSM-5. In addition, four cross-cutting review groups (Culture, Sex and Gender, Suicide, and Forensic) reviewed all the chapters, focusing on material involving their specific expertise. A Work Group on Ethnoracial Equity and Inclusion ensure that appropriate attention to risk factors like racism and discrimination and the use of non-stigmatizing language. DSM-5-TR includes a new diagnosis, prolonged grief disorder and new symptom codes that allow clinicians to indicate the presence or history of suicidal behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury. Some necessary clarifications to certain diagnostic criteria were reviewed and approved by the DSM Steering Committee, as well as the APA Assembly and Board of Trustees. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, (DSM-5) was the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. This manual is a valuable resource for psychiatrists, other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders with concise and explicit criteria intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings—inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM–5-TR easier to use across all settings. Learn more about some of the new organization and features of the DSM–5-TR below. DSM consists of three major components: the diagnostic classification, the diagnostic criteria sets, and the descriptive text. Diagnostic Classification The diagnostic classification is the official list of mental disorders recognized in DSM. Each diagnosis includes a diagnostic code, which is typically used by individual providers, institutions, and agencies for data collection and billing purposes. These diagnostic codes are derived from the coding system used by all U.S. health-care professionals, known as the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Diagnostic Criteria Sets For each disorder included in DSM, a set of diagnostic criteria indicates symptoms that must be present (and for how long) as well as a list of other symptoms, disorders, and conditions that must first be ruled out to qualify for a particular diagnosis. While these criteria help increase diagnostic reliability (i.e., the likelihood that two doctors would come up with the same diagnosis when using DSM to assess a patient), it is important to remember that these criteria are meant to be used by trained professionals using clinical judgment; they are not meant to be used by the general public. Descriptive Text The third area of DSM is the descriptive text that accompanies each disorder. The text of DSM–5-TR provides information about each disorder under the following headings: Recording Procedures Specifiers Diagnostic Features Associated Features Prevalence Development and Course Risk and Prognostic Factors Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Sex and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior Functional Consequences Differential Diagnosis Comorbidity History of the DSM Learn more about the history of the manual.

Sub Navigation About DSM-5-TR Toggle About DSM-5-TR Page Listing DSM History On This Page The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) was published in 2022. It involved more than 200 experts, the majority of whom were involved in the development of DSM-5. In addition, four cross-cutting review groups (Culture, Sex and Gender, Suicide, and Forensic) reviewed all the chapters, focusing on material involving their specific expertise. A Work Group on Ethnoracial Equity and Inclusion ensure that appropriate attention to risk factors like racism and discrimination and the use of non-stigmatizing language. DSM-5-TR includes a new diagnosis, prolonged grief disorder and new symptom codes that allow clinicians to indicate the presence or history of suicidal behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury. Some necessary clarifications to certain diagnostic criteria were reviewed and approved by the DSM Steering Committee, as well as the APA Assembly and Board of Trustees. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, (DSM-5) was the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. This manual is a valuable resource for psychiatrists, other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders with concise and explicit criteria intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings—inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM–5-TR easier to use across all settings. Learn more about some of the new organization and features of the DSM–5-TR below. DSM consists of three major components: the diagnostic classification, the diagnostic criteria sets, and the descriptive text. Diagnostic Classification The diagnostic classification is the official list of mental disorders recognized in DSM. Each diagnosis includes a diagnostic code, which is typically used by individual providers, institutions, and agencies for data collection and billing purposes. These diagnostic codes are derived from the coding system used by all U.S. health-care professionals, known as the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Diagnostic Criteria Sets For each disorder included in DSM, a set of diagnostic criteria indicates symptoms that must be present (and for how long) as well as a list of other symptoms, disorders, and conditions that must first be ruled out to qualify for a particular diagnosis. While these criteria help increase diagnostic reliability (i.e., the likelihood that two doctors would come up with the same diagnosis when using DSM to assess a patient), it is important to remember that these criteria are meant to be used by trained professionals using clinical judgment; they are not meant to be used by the general public. Descriptive Text The third area of DSM is the descriptive text that accompanies each disorder. The text of DSM–5-TR provides information about each disorder under the following headings: Recording Procedures Specifiers Diagnostic Features Associated Features Prevalence Development and Course Risk and Prognostic Factors Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Sex and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior Functional Consequences Differential Diagnosis Comorbidity History of the DSM Learn more about the history of the manual.
